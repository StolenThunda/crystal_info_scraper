This crystal is mainly found in its distinct dark green color, but can also be seen as white, yellow, grey or black. This mineral was first recorded back in 1794 by R. Kirwan. He named it after the Greek word “Aktis” which means “beam or ray”. This was used to describe the shape Actinolite forms in, and the name stuck ever since. Actinolite is a fairly common crystal that has localities all over the world. Countries such as Brazil, Russia, Canada, China, and the USA all have an abundance of this mineral below them!","Meaning & Energy":"Actinolite is a powerful heart stone that provides one’s emotional body with protection from negative energies. So often do negative vibrations attach themselves to us, causing one to feel sadness, anxiety and depression. Carrying or wearing this stone will provide one’s aura with a protective shield that refuses to allow negativity to come your way. Once one becomes fully protected from Actinolite, only then can this stone help one do a full evaluation of themselves."},"props":{"Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Love & Relationships":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/love-relationships","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Nourishing and Rejuvenation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nourishing-and-rejuvenation","Nuturing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nuturing","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Physical Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/physical-healing","Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Selflessness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/selflessness","Soothing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/soothing","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Claiming Wholeness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/claiming-wholeness","Compassion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/compassion","Consciousness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/consciousness","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Empathy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/empathy","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Generosity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/generosity","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/215/conversions/Actinolite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/215/Actinolite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Adamite.wav","Chakras":["Heart","Solar Plexus"],"Zodiacs":["Cancer"],"Elements":["Fire","Wind"],"Colors":["Green","Colorless","White","Yellow","Brown"],"id":"adamite","relURL":"/crystals/adamite","name":"Adamite","Formula":"Zn2(AsO4)(OH)","Hardness":{"min":4,"max":4},"Related":[{"Citrine":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/citrine"},{"Aegirine":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/aegirine"},{"Ruby in Kyanite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/ruby-in-kyanite"},{"Dolomite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/dolomite"},{"Ruby Zoisite (Anyolite)":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/ruby-zoisite-anyolite"},{"Ruby":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/ruby"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Adamite":"Adamite is a zinc arsenate mineral that was first discovered in 1866 in Chile.  Pure Adamite is colorless and usually less than an inch in diameter.

As you can clearly see, it’s a very complex mineral with an even more unusual crystal structure. It can occur in long prismatic crystals, double-terminated as bipyramid crystals, or as crusts coating a matrix (usually calcite or marble). This mineral ranges in color from light sky blue to a dark navy, but can also be seen as colorless and transparent. Afghanite was first discovered in 1968 by R. Giraud, F. Cesbron, and P. Bariand. They named it after the country they found it in, Afghanistan. It can be specifically traced to the Badakhshan region located in the northeastern corner of the country. Afghanite generally occurs near Sodalite family minerals, such as Hackmanite and Lazurite. Chemically, it’s very similar to Lazurite and gets its color from the same elements and components. Since Afghanite’s discovery over 50 years ago, deposits have been found in Canada, Russia, Tajikistan, Germany, Italy and the United States.","Meaning & Energy":"Afghanite vibrates at a very high frequency that can be felt immediately upon touch. It’s energies usually rush towards one’s third eye and crown chakra, activating and aligning our most potent chakras together. This unified channel has you connected to higher energies and uses your body as a vessel to channel them down to Earth. Afghanite activates your unique psychic abilities to help one receive messages from your spirit guides and guardian angels. This mineral helps one become more conscious of the minor details in any environment and to understand the true meaning behind certain symbolism being depicted. Our angels are always with us, and with the help of Afghanite’s awakening ability, one will finally be able to become aware of the path being laid out for them.","Combining Stones for Mental Clarity":"For any experienced practitioners who want to increase the strength of Afghanite’s energies, we recommend using Phenacite or Iceland Spar (Clear Calcite) in conjunction with Afghanite. Both crystals are extremely potent and assist one in maintaining mental clarity. This is so important when one is connected to higher realms while also living their day to day “earthly” life. These minerals help one better process and digest the information that’s being channeled through them on a daily basis."},"props":{"Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/higher-self","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Interdimensional Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/interdimensional-communication","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Living in the Present Moment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/living-in-the-present-moment","Lucid Dreaming":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/lucid-dreaming","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Mental Enhancement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mental-enhancement","New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Attunement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement","Alignment with the Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/alignment-with-the-higher-self","Angelic Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/angelic-communication","Ascension":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ascension","Astral Travel":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/astral-travel","Attraction":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attraction","Attunement With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement-with-higher-realms","Bridging the Spiritual and Physical Worlds":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/bridging-the-spiritual-and-physical-worlds","Channeling and Grounding Higher Vibrations":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/channeling-and-grounding-higher-vibrations","Communication With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-higher-realms","Communication with Guides":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-guides","Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality","Dreams":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dreams","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Generosity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/generosity"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/352/conversions/Afghanite-Group-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/353/conversions/Afghanite-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/354/conversions/Afghanite-Pyrite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/352/Afghanite-Group.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Agni%20Manitite%20(Pearl%20of%20the%20Divine%20Fire).wav","Parent Property":[],"Colors":["Grey","Smokey"],"Zodiacs":["Aries","Gemini"],"Elements":["Storm","Earth"],"Planets":["Earth"],"Chakras":["Solar Plexus"],"id":"agni-manitite-(pearl-of-the-divine-fire)","relURL":"/crystals/agni-manitite-(pearl-of-the-divine-fire)","name":"Agni Manitite (Pearl of the Divine Fire)","Formula":"n{SiO2}, p{CaCO3}","Hardness":{"min":5.5,"max":7},"Related":[{"Peanut Obsidian":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/peanut-obsidian"},{"Stromatolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/stromatolite"},{"Campo del Cielo (Meteorite) ":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/campo-del-cielo-meteorite"},{"Healer's Gold":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/healer-s-gold"},{"Orthoclase":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/orthoclase"},{"Rhyolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/rhyolite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Agni Manitite":"Agni Manitite, also known on the market as Pearl of Fire, is an extremely rare tektite found on the island of Java, Indonesia. The color ranges from a dark charcoal grey-black to a smoky translucent color. Its name is derived from the ancient Sanskrit term “agni mani”, meaning “pearl of the divine fire”. These tektites were formed when a meteorite crash landed over the Indonesian archipelago. This resulted in the heating of the surface that was enough to liquidize it, thus giving Mother Earth a mineral from out of this world. What makes this so rare, is that most of the pieces of Agni Manitite are now underwater, resulting in this tektite to be incredibly hard to come by. It’s unlike Moldavite, where farmers can just plow their fields and yield one of the highest regarded E.T. stones.","Meaning & Energy":"Pearl of Fire resonates directly with the solar plexus chakra, activating it and engaging it to “warp speed”. You’ll immediately notice the connection and overseeing ability of your personal energy levels and the unique attributes that make you, you. Most of these traits stem from our second brain (our gut) and hold the key to unlocking a majority of answers we may not have even been looking for. This Tektite specializes in raising your creative, manifestation, and adventurous energy levels to new heights. This is in hopes of one channeling their own conjured energy into the task, dream, goal or desire that is at the forefront of their mind. Pearl of Fire should result in increased confidence of yourself and your own capabilities. You are given a gift when you are born into this world; free will (consciousness). This is simply the ability to freely pick and choose your interests, while being consciously aware of your emotional state. Agni Manitite helps direct your own personal will to that which truly brings happiness and joy into your life. This results in better thinking, strength, and positivity that will spread throughout your physical vessel like wildfire.","Raising Your Vibrations":"While much of the world is busy distracted by 21st century problems, you are defining your soul amongst the rest by achieving a higher level of spirituality. This is exactly what a stone created from a space-drifting meteorite can do. This stone should serve as a reminder that anything is possible as long as your soul and mind can become synchronized with the world around you. By being able to understand your surroundings, one will become a leader amongst the pack. Just as a leader's role is to push forward and lead the way, they are also very respected and powerful beings. They have a community that listens and takes their word at the highest value. This is something one cannot just find in this world, rather it must be built over time. Agni Manitite pushes one's leadership values to the next level and helps you to slowly bring your own community together on a mission of peace, light, and self embetterment."},"props":{"High

& Origin of Amazonite":"Amazonite is a variety of Microcline, also referred to as an alkali feldspar mineral. This crystal forms in small prismatic crystals, or large masses. The colors of Amazonite range from a deep blue, to Turquoise, to blue-green. The stone was first reported back in 1847 by A. Breithaupt and its name derives from the Amazon River in Brazil, which host an abundance of Amazonite. Although it was reported in 1847, Amazonite is believed to have been used for at least 4,000 years. Ancient civilizations such as the Egypt, India, and Mesopotamia used this stone, and even a special scarab ring was found in King Tutankhamen’s burial chamber. Due to it’s forming in masses, many past civilizations used Amazonite as armor, talismans, amulets, trinkets, and writing slabs. For many years Amazonite’s color was believed to be derived from , but a 1985 study suggests otherwise. The study showed that the color was actually created from small traces of lead and water within the feldspar."},"props":{"Anger & Stress":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anger-stress","Emotional Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-healing","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Love & Relationships":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/love-relationships","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Alignment of Chakra":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/alignment-of-chakra","Adventures":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/adventures","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Life Path":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/life-path"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/187/conversions/IMG_1871-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/188/conversions/19301d383abae92e49ede4fb7ee16830-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/187/IMG_1871.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Amber.wav","Chakras":["Throat","Solar Plexus","Sacral"],"Zodiacs":["Leo","Libra","Aquarius"],"Elements":["Fire"],"Planets":["Sun"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Colors":["Brown","Red","Orange","Yellow","Pale Yellow","Brass-Yellow","Blood Red "],"id":"amber","relURL":"/crystals/amber","name":"Amber","Formula":"C10H16O","Hardness":{"min":2,"max":3},"Related":[{"Tiger Eye":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/tiger-eye"},{"Pyrite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pyrite"},{"Honey Calcite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/honey-calcite"},{"Truffle Chalcedony":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/truffle-chalcedony"},{"Pyrophyllite ":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pyrophyllite"},{"Red Tiger Eye":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/red-tiger-eye"}],"Origin":{},"props":{"Action":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/action","Abundance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/abundance","Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Creativity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creativity","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Physical Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/physical-healing","Purification":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/purification","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Light":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/light","Longevity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/longevity","Connection with Nature":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/connection-with-nature"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/7577/conversions/Amber-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/7578/conversions/Amber-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/7577/Amber.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Amethyst.wav","Planets":["Jupiter","Saturn","Neptune"],"Chakras":["Crown","Third Eye","Etheric"],"Zodiacs":["Virgo","Sagittarius","Capricorn","Aquarius","Pisces"],"Elements":["Wind"],"Colors":["Purple"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"amethyst","relURL":"/crystals/amethyst","name":"Amethyst","Formula":"SiO2","Hardness":{"min":7,"max":7},"Related":[{"Onyx ":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/black-onyx"},{"Dolomite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/dolomite"},{"NWA 4420 Meteorite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/nwa-4420-meteorite"},{"Selenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/selenite"},{"Red Jasper":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/red-jasper"},{"Black Tourmaline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/black-tourmaline"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Amethyst":"Amethyst is a purple variety of Quartz that has become one of the most popular and well-known crystals in the mineral kingdom. Amethyst gains its color from gamma irradiation and trace amounts of Iron. This crystal gained its name from the Greek word \"Amethystos\" which translates to \"not intoxicated\". This stone is given special names depending on its formation or locality, including Rwanda Amethyst and Chevron Amethyst . Most of the world's supply of Amethyst currently comes out of Brazil and Uruguay. Specimens in both these South American countries have been found as tall as small buildings and can sell for millions of dollars! Each year it seems as though a new Amethyst deposit is found in a faraway country. It's anyone's guess as to where the next discovery will be!","Heat Treated Citrine":"When Amethyst is heated to more than 300-400 degrees its purple turns into a bright orange and is incorrectly sold as Citrine. Beware of purchasing brightly colored Citrine pieces from untrusted sellers!","Les Amours de Bacchus":"In Greek lore, Amethyst appeared as a young virgin who was traveling to worship at the Temple of Diana. During her journey, she was approached by Bacchus, the god of wine, fertility, and agriculture. He became enraged when she declined his advance and summoned two tigers to pounce on her. At that exact moment, the goddess Diana emerged and encased Amethyst in a massive Quartz crystal for her protection. Upon seeing her encapsulated in this gleaming crystal, Bacchus denounced his actions and poured his glass of wine over Amethyst, coating the clear quartz crystal with a purple glow.","Ancient Myths":"In many ancient texts, Amethyst is regarded as a stone that when worn, allows the user to avoid intoxication. However, there is speculation that the reason this myth came about was due to a misidentification. Some believe that the Amethyst was actually Red Garnet. When this \"Amethyst\" was used as a serving glass, the clear water that was poured into it would turn red like wine (due to the reddish runoff). This liquid would create an illusion to others as though the consumer was drinking wine yet could avoid intoxication.","Meaning & Energy":"Amethyst is a multidimensional stone that offers a range of energetic uses. Its protective bubble helps one maintain mental clarity and physical energy. We recommend starting your meditations with gratitude while offering yourself up to the purple rays from this remarkable stone. Begin channeling your own energy with that of Amethyst's and remind your auric field to accept the love around you. As you work with this stone, one will feel a sense of warmth and gratitude surrounding them. This is due to them knowing that they are finally in a safe place where they can feel once again.","Breaking Addictions":"Amethyst allows our consciousness to connect with energies at a much higher frequency than we would normally each day. Most of these energies are multidimensional and can assist one in raising their own personal intuitive levels. This is vital for anyone looking to release the daily weight and stress that we place on ourselves. In the moment, one is simply looking for comfort rather than evolving (especially on a spiritual level). With Amethyst's energies, one's intuition awakens and moves to the forefront of your mind. In the moment, we may not know what exactly is right for us, but that feeling within (and that thought that cannot be shaken) is always our consciousness making the right decision. This ability separates those who are willing to grow and accept change and those who cannot undergo stress and discomfort."},"props":{"Retrograde":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/retrograde","Breaking Addictions":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/breaking-addictions","Travel":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/travel","Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Dreams":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dreams","Clarity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clarity","Sleep":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sleep","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Physical Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/physical-healing","Purification":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/purification","Clairvoyance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clairvoyance","Self-Discipline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discipline","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Focus":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/focus","Expansion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expansion","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/125/conversions/IMG_0530-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/20/conversions/a203cf57cfd6c117e6e2164d18029161-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/125/IMG_0530.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Ammonite.wav","Planets":["Earth"],"Chakras":["Third Eye"],"Zodiacs":["Aquarius"],"Elements":["Water","Earth"],"Colors":["Grey","White","Brown"],"id":"ammonite","relURL":"/crystals/ammonite","name":"Ammonite","Formula":"Ca(CO3)","Hardness":{"min":3,"max":9},"Related":[{"Dravite (Brown Tourmaline)":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/dravite-brown-tourmaline"},{"Ruby Zoisite (Anyolite)":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/ruby-zoisite-anyolite"},{"Shiva Lingam":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/shiva-lingam"},{"White Calcite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/white-calcite"},{"Charoite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/charoite"},{"Goethite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/goethite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Ammonite":"Ammonites are an extinct group of mollusk animals that are closely related to octopuses and squid. The earliest traces of Ammonite date back to 420 million years ago, while the last known traces fall to 60 million years ago. Its name is derived from the Egyptian god Ammon, who was depicted wearing a ram's horn. Pliny the Elder first recorded these fossils in 79 A.D. near Pompeii and originally named them Ammonis Cornua after their horn-like shape. The creatures that lived in these shells swam in open waters, filling chambers of the shell with gas to maintain buoyancy. Ammonites are found all over the world, however, a large majority of the commercial supply comes out of Morocco.","Meaning & Energy":"Ammonites are one of the very few meditation trinkets that contain ancient life force energy capable of being channeled into the present day. Much like Petrified Wood and Orthoceras, Ammonites were alive and well during a much different world than what we see today. These creatures lived in a habitat capable of creating megalith animals partially due to the heightened oxygen levels within Earth’s atmosphere. The energies in which they held were abundant in strength, perseverance, and longevity. These attributes of Earth’s first biological creatures can still be felt today when meditating with a mind willing to understand and accept the past. Only when we learn from our ancestral past can we grow and change.","Primordial Origins":"Ammonites were one of the longest living creatures this world has ever seen. They roamed our seas freely for nearly 350 million years. This was a testament to their will to not only live but become intelligent enough to outwit millions of years of evolutionary creatures. These ancient mollusks were widely hunted, yet thrived on fear to be able to progress and develop over time. This is very reminiscent of our own place in this world today. Each day our energies are given to the wrong person and have the ability to result in being taken advantage of. The natural predatory instinct of all creatures on Earth when we are being prayed upon causes us to activate our intuition and listen to our voice of reason. Ammonites’ deep earthen energy provides us with guidance and leadership to further distance ourselves from harmful situations (much like our Ammonite friend had to do each and every day)."},"props":{"Sexuality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sexuality","Past Lives":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/past-lives","Creativity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creativity","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Abundance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/abundance","Prosperity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/prosperity","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Transmutation of Negative Energies":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transmutation-of-negative-energies","Longevity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/longevity","Kundalini":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/kundalini","Ancient Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ancient-knowledge","Life Path":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/life-path","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Grief and Mourning":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grief-and-mourning","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/109/conversions/7d43cbc65086443431db09d4e7f12123-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/109/7d43cbc65086443431db09d4e7f12123.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Angel%20Aura%20Quartz.wav","Colors":["Metallic","White","Silver","Colorless"],"Parent Property":[],"Planets":["Moon","Sun"],"Chakras":["Etheric","Crown"],"Elements":["Wind"],"Zodiacs":["Aries"],"id":"angel-aura-quartz","relURL":"/crystals/angel-aura-quartz","name":"Angel Aura Quartz","Formula":"SiO2","Hardness":{"min":7,"max":7},"Related":[{"Super Seven":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/super-seven"},{"Pinolith (Pinolite)":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pinolith-pinolite"},{"Tektite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/tektite"},{"Blue Topaz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/blue-topaz"},{"Goshenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/goshenite"},{"Purpurite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/purpurite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Angel Aura Quartz":"Angel Aura Quartz, also known as Aura Lite, is the name given to Quartz that undergoes extreme heat (1600*F),and then coated with a special blend of metals such as Platinum, Gold, and Silver.

& Origin of Angelite":"Angelite also known as Blue Anhydrite is a mineral first discovered in 1989 by J.I. Koivula and R.C. Kammerling. Anhydrite, which is only found in Peru, is an anhydrous calcium sulfate mineral that can associate itself with Calcites and Halites. This stone mainly crystallizes in the form of masses and is rarely seen in crystal form. You can find this stone on the market in the form of massage wands, animal carvings, jewelry and eggs.","Meaning & Energy":"Angelite is a very high vibrational stone that activates and aligns our throat, third eye, and crown chakras. This stone will help attune oneself to a higher frequency, which helps connect both their guardian angels and spirit guides. Using this stone as a meditation tool will help transmit and vocalize (into the physical plane) the knowledge in which you absorb through the third eye and crown connection. Angelite is a very powerful communication stone when it comes to connecting to other realms and frequencies. As you work with this stone repeatedly, you’ll notice your inner vision becoming more vivid. Your dreams will be easier to understand, allowing you to be more in touch with your psychic abilities and how to channel them.","Psychic Abilities & Dreams":"If you’re someone that is trying to activate your own unique psychic abilities, we recommend working with Angelite alongside other high vibrational stones. Angelite will assist one during lucid dreaming attempts, especially if you place the stone next to the pillow you sleep on. By strengthening your connection to the dream realm and other dimensions, one will become more attuned to this frequency. During this time dreams will be more controllable, with each little message having a symbolic meaning behind it. You will naturally pick up on these signs and their meaning, as opposed to someone who doesn’t remember their dreams. "},"props":{"Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Dreams":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dreams","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Clairvoyance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clairvoyance","Angelic Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/angelic-communication","Weight Control":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/weight-control","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Lucid Dreaming":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/lucid-dreaming","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/431/conversions/DSC01883-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/432/conversions/IMG_1886-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/431/DSC01883.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://cdn.reamaze.com/audio/snapup.mp3","Planets":["Saturn"],"Chakras":["Root"],"Zodiacs":["Scorpio","Sagittarius"],"Elements":["Earth","Fire"],"Colors":["Black"],"Parent Property":[],"id":"apache-tears","relURL":"/crystals/apache-tears","name":"Apache Tears","Formula":"Unknown","Hardness":{"min":5,"max":5.5},"Related":[{"Chinese Writing Stone":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/chinese-writing-stone"},{"Gaspeite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/gaspeite"},{"Hanksite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/hanksite"},{"Rhyolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/rhyolite"},{"Moss Agate":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/moss-agate"},{"Axinite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/axinite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Apache Tears":"Apache Tears, also known as Obsidianite and Marekanite, is a special variety of black Obsidian that crystallized in the form of small, indented pebbles (around 1”-2”). It was created by silica-rich lava that became embedded within the high water content mineral Perlite(a volcanic glass formed when water is absorbed during the cooling process of lava). When the hydration process of Perlite was over or partially finished, you're left with small Obsidian concretions that we refer to as Apache Tears. This has occurred a few times within the United States, most notably in Superior, Arizona. This southern Arizona town (originally called Queen and then Hastings) is believed to be the type locality (original discovery) of this mineral, estimated to have been found around the late 1800s to early 1900s. Since then, Apache Tears have also been discovered in western Nevada and southwestern Utah. Both of these discoveries are believed to have occurred in the middle of the 20th century.","Meaning & Energy":"The name “Apache Tears”, comes from a sad backstory that takes place during the height of the American Indian War. In the 1870s there was a fierce battle between the U.S. Cavalry and about 75 members of the Apache Tribe. This conflict took place atop a mountain (posthumously renamed Apache Leap) overlooking present-day Superior, Arizona. As the American Indians became outnumbered and enemy forces were approaching with haste, the tribesmen decided to take their fate into their own hands and  ride their horses off the cliff to their death. As family members and wives of the great men heard the tragic news, they began to weep and cry endless tears. It is these tears that are believed to have been turned into stone, in what we refer to as Apache tears."},"props":{"Creativity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creativity","Balance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balance","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Courage":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/courage","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Confidence":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/confidence","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Power":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/power","Physical

& Origin of Apophyllite":"Apophyllite is a hydrated potassium calcium silicate mineral that crystallizes in the form of pyramidal structures, cubic crystals, as well as druzy on a matrix or other minerals. This mineral was first discovered in 1806 by R.J. Hauy, and was named after the Greek word meaning “leaf”. This name was chosen because of its unique tendency to crumble when heated. The common color of Apophyllite is clear or white, although it can also be found as grey, yellow, red, and green. Green Apophyllite is the rarest color of them all and was found a few decades ago by an Indian farmer in Poona, India. Since then, Green Apophyllite can also be found in Brazil and Quebec, Canada. Notable localities for the common white or translucent forms of Apophyllite include India, Australia, Russia, Germany, Greenland, Italy, and the USA.","Meaning & Energy":"Apophyllite is a very high vibrational stone that helps one attune their energies to those of higher dimensions and realms. This stone is here to connect one with their guardian angels and spirits who are guiding them on this journey of life. Our third eye and crown chakras become unlocked, with a powerful connection formed between the two. This channel will help one understand the images and energies they see and feel when meditating with this stone. Apophyllite is a perfect tool for anyone looking to expand their consciousness and connect to a foreign realm not like our own. All practitioners of astral projection and lucid dreaming need a piece of Apophyllite at their bedside. This stone will fill one's entire room with high vibrational energy that will allow one to easily transcend into the abyss. ","Crystal Pairings":"For beginners who have just started working with crystals, we recommend placing grounding stones around your piece of Apophyllite. The energies can sometimes feel too strong and overwhelm practitioners who have not experienced a very high vibrational stone before. Some grounding stones we suggest that will keep you linked to earth are Black Tourmaline, , , Shungite, and Hematite. "},"props":{"Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Communication with Guides":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-guides","Connection with Nature":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/connection-with-nature","Dreams":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dreams","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/higher-self","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Interdimensional Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/interdimensional-communication","Communication With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-higher-realms","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Mental Enhancement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mental-enhancement","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","High Vibration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/high-vibrations","Alignment with the Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/alignment-with-the-higher-self","Angelic Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/angelic-communication","Ascension":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ascension","Astral Travel":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/astral-travel","Attunement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement","Attunement With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement-with-higher-realms","Bridging the Spiritual and Physical Worlds":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/bridging-the-spiritual-and-physical-worlds","Channeling and Grounding Higher Vibrations":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/channeling-and-grounding-higher-vibrations","Channeling":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/channeling","Clarity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clarity"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/216/conversions/Apophylite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/216/Apophylite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Aquamarine.wav","Parent Property":[],"Planets":["Neptune"],"Chakras":["Throat","Heart"],"Zodiacs":["Aries","Gemini","Pisces"],"Elements":["Water"],"Colors":["Blue","Green","Light Blue"],"id":"aquamarine","relURL":"/crystals/aquamarine","name":"Aquamarine","Formula":"Be3Al2Si6O18","Hardness":{"min":8,"max":8},"Related":[{"Amazonite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/amazonite"},{"Blue Aragonite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/blue-aragonite"},{"Chrysocolla":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/chrysocolla"},{"Shattuckite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/shattuckite"},{"Labradorite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/labradorite"},{"Larimar":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/larimar"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Aquamarine":"Aquamarine is a blue variety of Beryl that crystallizes in hexagonal columns. The blue color of this stone comes from minor traces of iron. It can commonly be found in association with Muscovite. This crystal is a very rare stone that has a long history. The first recorded use of this mineral was around 400 B.C. in Greece, but has been used throughout multiple societies for over 2,000 years. Aquamarine can be found in the United States, Brazil, Australia and several other countries throughout Africa. The highest quality specimens currently on the market are coming out of Pakistan and Afghanistan.","Speak the Truth With Aquamarine":"Aquamarine is a very special stone that helps in opening a clear channel between your heart and throat chakras. This ever so important connection allows one to constantly speak from the heart and to the highest truths. This beryl variety is a perfect stone to help aid you in the solving of conflicts, arguments and disagreements. Aquamarine can also support you in cooling those fiery emotions that desire to overtake us. The water element shines bright in this stone and urges us to peel back a layer of ourselves to allow that inner being to glow. In addition Aquamarine is here to help you constantly refresh your emotions and provide mental clarity. There are times when your heart will be completely open and clear, but yet your mind may tend to still be foggy. Aquamarine supports us in wisdom, intellect, knowledge, the enhancement of ideas, and clarity of the mind. When one’s open heart and clear mind are able to work in sync, the opportunities and relationships will become endless.","Communicating Through Aquamarine":"This blue beauty is a stone of pure communication. Wearing or carrying a piece daily will help in choosing the right words, tone, and ideas when speaking to someone. Aquamarine softens the harsh rhetoric that can come out during disagreements, while also assisting one in focusing on clear communication. This stone is perfect for any teacher, manager, therapist, professor, or anyone else who often speaks publicly. The power that comes from Aquamarine can boost one's confidence when speaking to a large crowd, and will help even the strongest stage fright cease to exist. This gemstone is here to help show the world the incredible communication skills you possess, and how they can be used to engage with large crowds or more personal conversations.","Crystal Pairings":"Aquamarine is a very high vibrational stone that helps us develop and find our individual spiritual paths. This stone works very well with other crystals in the mineral kingdom, and we highly recommend meditating with other heart stones. Using these other stones in association with Aquamarine can help in the opening, cleansing, clearing, and speed in which one’s heart heals. Some of the few common heart stones we recommend are Rhodonite, Green Opal, Rose Quartz, Pink Halite, Chrysocolla and Green Calcite."},"props":{"Anger & Stress":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anger-stress","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/higher-self","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/7131/conversions/Aquamarine-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/7131/Aquamarine.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://cdn.reamaze.com/audio/snapup.mp3","Planets":["Earth"],"Chakras":["Crown","Third Eye","Throat","Heart","Solar Plexus","Sacral","Root"],"Zodiacs":["Capricorn"],"Elements":["Storm"],"Colors":["Blue","Green","Red","White","Yellow","Brown"],"id":"aragonite-","relURL":"/crystals/aragonite-","name":"Aragonite ","Formula":"Ca(CO3)","Hardness":{"min":4,"max":4},"Related":[{"Lava Rock":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/lava-rock"},{"Green Apatite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/green-apatite"},{"Smithsonite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/smithsonite"},{"Black Moonstone":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/black-moonstone"},{"Prehnite ":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/prehnite"},{"Auralite-23":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/auralite-23"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Aragonite":"Aragonite, also known as Golfball or Sputnik Aragonite, is one of the three calcium carbonate minerals that naturally occurs within mother nature (the other two being Calcite and Vaterite). It's commonly found crystallized in the form of small prismatic crystals, masses, stalactites, and spherical radiating aggregates. Aragonite was first discovered in 1790 by Abraham Gottlob Werner in Molina de Aragón, Guadalajara, Castile-La Mancha, Spain. Since then, Aragonite has been found worldwide, especially in countries such as Mexico, Pakistan, Italy, the U.K., and the United States.","Formation & Colors":"The most common Aragonites on the market are the \"sputnik\" variety from Morocco. They almost always display a golden brown to hue but can also appear colorless. Other common color varieties of Aragonite include white, green, red, violet, yellow, and most recently blue. The Blue Aragonite specimens that have come onto the market over the last few decades are absolutely stunning. They are mostly found in mass or stalactite form and can fetch thousands of dollars. Most, if not all, Blue Aragonite on the market originates from China.","Sea Life":"Several marine animals are made of Aragonite! Some everyday examples of Aragonite occurring in the marine ecosphere are mollusk shells, coral skeletons, and cave stalactites. In a rare occurrence, extinct ammonite shells (which are composed of Aragonite) can naturally become iridescent. This unusual mineral creation is referred to as Ammonite and is currently only found in the Rocky Mountains of North America.","Meaning & Energy":"Aragonite is one of the most powerful beginner stones a newcomer can get their hands on. Its potent energies help activate and align our entire chakra column to promote inner-balance, mental clarity, and transformation. No matter the color, you can expect Aragonite to boast powerful yet ambiguous energy to overtake one's aura. These vibrations can push one to make a change in their daily life. This push will promote confidence, self-healing, and personal betterment.","Balance":"Balance is often a word used in ancient texts and martial arts. This attribute comes from the soul and is the basis of our development. To achieve this, one must truly be in touch with themselves while being able to give peaceful offerings to their surroundings. Through peace comes love, from love comes strength, and from strength comes balance.","Chakra Alignment":"We may often find ourselves \"out of balance\" or \"off-center\", due to our chakras being misaligned. Reiki practitioners specialize in the revitalization and realignment of our chakra system. If you cannot find a reputable one, we recommend meditating with a balancing stone such as Aragonite. Choose your favorite chakra cleansing meditation and place your piece of Aragonite on the chakra most displaced. Relax your entire body and clear any thoughts that may be lingering in your mind. Take this time for yourself and allow your intuition to identify and dissolve wherever the negativity may be housed. Repeatedly doing so will increase your chakra column's strength and help assist in avoiding any future misalignments."},"props":{"Trauma":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trauma-1","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Balance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balance","Courage":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/courage","Confidence":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/confidence","Grounding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grounding","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/higher-self","Focus":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/focus","Alignment of Chakra":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/alignment-of-chakra","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Attunement With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement-with-higher-realms","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Mental Enhancement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mental-enhancement","Channeling and Grounding Higher Vibrations":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/channeling-and-grounding-higher-vibrations","Connection with Nature":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/connection-with-nature","Motivation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/motivation","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Interdimensional Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/interdimensional-communication"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/87/conversions/291e9c2181a44441980e87c082c79f46-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/7132/conversions/Arag-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/87/291e9c2181a44441980e87c082c79f46.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Arfvedsonite.wav","Colors":["Light Blue","Black","Blue"],"Parent Property":[],"Elements":["Storm"],"Zodiacs":["Gemini"],"Planets":["Mercury"],"Chakras":["Throat"],"id":"arfvedsonite","relURL":"/crystals/arfvedsonite","name":"Arfvedsonite","Formula":"(Na)(Na2)(Fe2+4Fe3+)Si8O22(OH)2","Hardness":{"min":5,"max":6},"Related":[{"Blue Topaz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/blue-topaz"},{"Mangano Calcite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/mangano-calcite"},{"Golden Mica":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/golden-mica"},{"Blue Chalcedony":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/blue-chalcedony"},{"Preseli Bluestone":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/preseli-bluestone"},{"Orthoclase":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/orthoclase"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Arfvedsonite":"Arfvedsonite is a rare sodium amphibole mineral that crystallizes in the form of large masses, small prismatic shards, and fan-like prisms. It ranges in color from a dark black (with high-flash blue inclusions) to a deep blue or blue-green. Arfvedsonite is a newer crystal in the mineral kingdom, having first contact with humans around 1823. The man who discovered this mineral and who’s name forever encompasses Arfvedsonite is none other than Johan August Arfwedson. If that name looks familiar it's due to the legacy he left behind, for his greatest achievement in life was discovering Lithium. Arfvedsonite has only a few major localities throughout the entire world, with most major commercialized operations seizing or having stopped their production completely. Important deposits have been discovered in Antarctica, China, Canada, Malawi, Greenland, Russia, New Zealand, Norway, and the United States.","Meaning & Energy":"Arfvedsonite has a supercharged energy within, capable of calming your emotional body while still maintaining a cool, collective mentality. This is perfect in times of distress, where one must be an adult and handle their responsibilities with a “poker face”. It pushes one to internalize their feelings until they are in a safe space or with a loved one where they can be vocalized. Doing so helps maintain an image of strength, while allowing your subconscious to remain in deep thought. During this time, one may come to the realization that it is a waste of time, energy, and emotion to hold onto something so minute. This will cause a natural release of negativity (a self purification experience) and give you the ability to laugh or talk about it afterwards with ease.","Opening Communication Channels":"Arfvedsonite helps open your throat chakra to allow an outpouring of emotions, thoughts and feelings that one bears within. We recommend trying a new exercise to help one better communicate their emotional state. Try looking in the mirror while firmly grasping your piece of Arfvedsonite and slowly begin talking to yourself about the issues hurting you in that moment. Allow yourself to truly vacate whatever it is in your mind or heart, knowing that you are fully protected by Arfvedsonite’s energies. Do this a few times a week or each night before you go to bed and watch as you slowly begin to open yourself up (emotionally and spiritually) to the world around you."},"props":{"Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Longevity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/longevity","Living in the Present Moment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/living-in-the-present-moment","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Mastering Fear":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mastering-fear","Mental Enhancement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mental-enhancement","New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","PTSD":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ptsd","Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Self-Discipline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discipline","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Selflessness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/selflessness","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Claiming Wholeness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/claiming-wholeness","Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication","Compassion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/compassion","Courage":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/courage","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Empathy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/empathy","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Generosity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/generosity","Focus":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/focus","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Life Path":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/life-path"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/4962/conversions/Arfvedsonite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/4962/Arfvedsonite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Astrophyllite.wav","Chakras":["Root","Sacral","Solar Plexus","Heart","Throat","Third Eye","Crown"],"Elements":["Storm"],"Zodiacs":["Scorpio"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Colors":["Brown","Black","Metallic"],"Planets":["Pluto"],"Parent Property":[],"id":"astrophyllite","relURL":"/crystals/astrophyllite","name":"Astrophyllite","Formula":"K2NaFe2+7Ti2Si8O26(OH)4F","Hardness":{"min":3,"max":4},"Related":[{"Campo del Cielo (Meteorite) ":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/campo-del-cielo-meteorite"},{"Axinite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/axinite"},{"Saussurite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/saussurite"},{"Limonite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/limonite"},{"Rhyolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/rhyolite"},{"Healer's Gold":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/healer-s-gold"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Astrophyllite":"Astrophyllite is a very rare potassium, iron, titanium, manganese, sodium, silicate mineral. It crystallizes in the form of fine-bladed crystals that sometimes display a “starburst” aggregate. It was originally discovered in 1844 in Laven Island, Norway by Paul Christian Weibye. After that, it wasn’t officially welcomed into the scientific community until 10 years later, when Carl Johan August Theodor Scheerer officially named it “Astrophyllite”. He chose this in reference to its physical characteristics as well as the Greek words “Astron” and “Phyllon”, meaning “star” and “leaf”. Astrophyllite can only be found in a few countries worldwide, with the majority of specimens coming out of Russia, Greenland, China, Norway, and the United States.","Meaning & Energy":"Astrophyllite is one of those multidimensional stones that helps one connect and achieve attunement to realms beyond our own understanding. Through deep meditation and trust with this stone, one is able to take their spiritual journey to completely new heights. Your entire chakra column readjusts and realigns itself when one engages their energies with that of Astrophyllite. Inner balance will become easily achievable, and a deeper focus will provide clarity of our membrane. As you begin to open your mental capacity up and accept higher forms of knowledge, one must understand their internal vibration will never be the same! Your entire essence and aura will evolve, allowing you to excel much further than others here on planet Earth. Through this stone, one will finally understand what internal trust and self-love mean. Astrophyllite’s energies cannot connect to closed minds and only offers growth to those fully accepting of its energies.

unknown!"},"props":{"Abundance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/abundance","Action":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/action","Adventures":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/adventures","Alignment

The only locality in existence is the place of its initial discovery, north of Lake Superior in Ontario, Canada. Auralite-23 was only recently discovered and pushed onto the mineral market within the last 20 years, making it one of the newest and fastest selling crystals in the 21st century so far. The name is derived from the “23” minerals that are contained within the chemical composition of the stone (the main being an Amethyst base with inclusions within). We always preface the fact that although 23 minerals have been found in some crystals from this mine, it does not mean that ALL crystals from this mine automatically contain them all. This does not take away from the unique and limitless energy one can channel when working with this piece in a spiritual setting. Most of the 23 minerals can only be seen under a microscope, with a few dominate crystals forging the appearance of this diverse stone (Amethyst, Quartz, and Hematite).The 23 minerals within Auralite 23 (not counting the “base” mineral Amethyst) are:","Fake Varieties":"Since Auralite-23 has come onto the market, there has been an enormous wave of dealers and retailers selling “fake” and altered varieties of Amethyst as “Auralite-23”. Most are low-quality Quartz or Amethyst crystals which have been heated to extremely high temperatures to remove outside impurities and brighten the color. This is common with Hematite coated Amethyst (usually from Brazil or Uruguay), and is extremely hard to tell the difference between the two with a naked eye. The only advice we can offer is to truly know who you are buying it from. We, for example, are highly cautious of this rampant and unethical trading, and only entrust one small supplier with our limited supply.","Meaning & Energy":"Auralite-23 radiates an energy foreign to most individuals, especially practitioners who are truly disconnected from their own soul. Immediately upon touch, one can understand the craze behind this stone, and why developing a small “obsessions” of Auralite-23 is actually quite common. The soothing energies that one feels going through their body is the work of so many different chemical components and CAN NOT be replicated anywhere else (we like to compare it to your favorite dessert that can only be made by that one special individual who knows the “secret ingredient”). These energies directly resonate with your chakra column, and allow for complete alignment and reconciliation amongst your entire internal system. Very few stones in the mineral community have the ability to do that, with most requiring multiple sessions to truly access and understand their complex energies. Auralite-23 can change you in one medium-length meditation session if you're truly willing to “let go” and embrace the powers that be. We highly encourage you to meditate with this stone once a day for around 10-14 days, then completely stop and go “cold-turkey”. See for yourself the direct impact it has on your day to day life, as well as your attitude and mental strength. You may have to expose yourself to the darkness and live there for a few moments, but one will come out of it eternally grateful and eager to begin their spiritual journey once more.","Sacred Rejuvenation":"Auralite-23 is a 21st century talisman that has remained hidden within the Earth for far too long. Think about how old this stone is (1.5 billion years old) and how we are just finding this complex creation now. Our belief is that this crystal is a counterbalance to the extreme energies we face in this new world. An energy that can help us continue to find our way on this planet and accept nothing but the best for ourselves. That mentality has long been forgotten in this world, with so many distractions and societal stressors coming our way at all times. Auralite-23 is a reminder to take time out for yourself and embrace those sacred minutes for all of the healing and rejuvenation you need. You are your biggest ally and can do anything you set your heart and mind too. Embrace who you are and let the purple rays of Auralite-23 push you towards new and ever-growing heights."},"props":{"High

crystals off a rock matrix (usually Orthoclase or Granite). The most common form on the market is Ferroaxinite, which refers to the high Iron content within the chemical body. This elemental inclusion directly affects the color of the stone, resulting in a light black, brown, and grey.","Meaning & Energy":"Axinite is a potent tool for use in general expansion, more specifically, your connection to Mother Earth. The intuition we bear and the intelligence of our surroundings are a direct result of ancient earthen energies being channeled into you each day. Our planet is over 4 billion years old and has been capable of harnessing life during much of its existence. This is in part due to the natural nurturing effects Mother Earth passively radiates. For eons, diverse creatures and beings have walked our homeland; rising and falling, helping form new, protective layers of our planet. Cataclysmic events have come, stayed, and left; only to reveal the strength our celestial planet truly has. With each force of destruction, Earth has been able to restabilize itself and begin a new life cycle. Axinite is a crystal which hardens this life force energy and provides the “mirror” you may need to see your true strength."},"props":{"Mastering

mineral that forms in masses, stalactites, botryoidal, and short prismatic crystals. Azurite in crystal form is extremely rare and expensive, but truly unique. This mineral was named in 1824 by F.S. Beaudant for its true blue color. Azurite has been widely used throughout history, during the early nineteenth century it was referred to as “Chessylite” (after the area in which it was first found in eastern France) and  “Kuanos” by Gaius Plinius Secundus in the book, “Natural History”. This stone has had a number of different uses where in Ancient Egypt, Azurite was used for paint, treating certain mental disorders, and smelted to create copper.","K2 Variation":"A variation of this stone was discovered at the base of K2 which is the second tallest mountain in the world. K2, the name of the stone, is comprised of white granite with drops of Malachite and Azurite  that occurred after the formation of the primary stone. Its emergence is widely argued, but if you’d like to learn more about K2, click here!","Azurite Meaning & Energy":"Azurite is a stone that activates and unlocks our third eye and crown chakras, thereby linking the two. It's known as one of the premier stones when it comes to accessing our own psychic abilities. It can assist you with lucid dreaming, astral projection, intuitive meditation, insight, and inner vision. If one has many dreams and often wonders what they mean, then this is the perfect stone for you! Azurite can help enhance those very dreams and decode their imagery. Azurite will raise one's mental awareness, intellect, and wisdom that can help you reach new goals and desires. This copper carbonate is all about the mind and will help in the cleansing and purging of negativity within it. Azurite brings with it great clarity that can help in the disposing of negative thoughts, bad habits, and even addictions."},"props":{"Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Confidence":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/confidence","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Communication with Guides":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-guides"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/307/conversions/Azurite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/307/Azurite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Barite.wav","Elements":["Storm"],"Chakras":["Third Eye","Crown"],"Colors":["Blue","White","Grey","Yellow","Pale Yellow","Brown"],"Parent Property":[],"Zodiacs":["Aquarius"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"barite","relURL":"/crystals/barite","name":"Barite","Formula":"BaSO4","Hardness":{"min":3,"max":4},"Related":[{"K2":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/k2"},{"Colorless Topaz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/colorless-topaz"},{"Apophyllite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/apophyllite"},{"Tanzanite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/tanzanite"},{"Shattuckite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/shattuckite"},{"Snowflake Obsidian":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/snowflake-obsidian"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Barite":"Barite, or Baryte, is a barium sulfate mineral that crystallizes in the form of masses, tabular crystals, and even rarely, stalactites. This mineral was first recorded in 1800 by D.L.G. Karsten, and was named for the Greek word meaning “heavy”, due to its high specific gravity. Barite’s color palette includes blue, white, grey, yellow, and brown. The most common form Barite is found in is its distinct “Desert Rose” shape. This shape occurs naturally and consists of blades of Barite almost perfectly forming the shape of a beautiful rose. Barite is most abundantly found in the countries of Romania, England, Morocco, and the USA","Meaning & Energy":"Barite is a crystal that activates our third eye and crown chakras, bringing with it energies that help awaken ones psychic abilities. It's a stone of inner vision, inter- dimensional travel, and communication with our guides and guardian angels. Barite pushes us to come in contact with and align to our higher self, which passively increased ones wisdom and mental awareness. Meditating with this stone will push one to operate on a higher frequency and can cause increased lucid dreaming, E.S.P., and “deja vu” moments. These moments are all occurring to push you towards the correct life path that you truly desire. The universe, and your higher self, is assisting you along the physical journey of your life.","Crystal Pairings":"When working on reaching and communicating with higher realms, we recommend meditating with stones such as Angelite, Amethyst, Phenacite, or even Moldavite. All of these stones work on an extremely high level and can help in establishing the initial connection between you and your guides. Also, we recommend carrying one of these stones daily in association with Barite. Doing so will help attune one to these higher energies, and make them much more comfortable during meditation sessions."},"props":{"High Vibration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/high-vibrations","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Interdimensional Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/interdimensional-communication","Astral Travel":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/astral-travel","Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Ascension":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ascension","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Mental Enhancement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mental-enhancement","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Lucid Dreaming":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/lucid-dreaming","Communication with Guides":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-guides","Dreams":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dreams","Energy Transfer":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/energy-transfer","Alignment with the Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/alignment-with-the-higher-self","Attunement With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement-with-higher-realms","Communication With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-higher-realms","Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/higher-self"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/425/conversions/Barite-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/157/conversions/7817333B-2987-45D1-A7EC-70157F112CCA-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/425/Barite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Black%20Kyanite.wav","Planets":["Jupiter","Saturn"],"Chakras":["Crown","Third Eye","Throat","Heart","Solar Plexus","Sacral","Root"],"Zodiacs":["Aries","Libra","Pisces"],"Elements":["Storm"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Parent Property":[],"Colors":["Black","Grey"],"id":"black-kyanite","relURL":"/crystals/black-kyanite","name":"Black Kyanite","Formula":"Al2(SiO4)O","Hardness":{"min":4,"max":5},"Related":[{"Selenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/selenite"},{"Pink Halite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pink-halite"},{"Phenacite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/phenacite"},{"Golden Healer Quartz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/golden-healer-quartz"},{"Black Tourmaline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/black-tourmaline"},{"Vivianite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/vivianite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Black Kyanite":"Black Kyanite is an aluminum-rich silicate mineral that forms in pegmatites at extremely high pressure. It crystallizes in the form of “fan-like” blades that can reach nearly half a foot in length! Most of the Black Kyanite on the market comes directly from the Minas Gerais region of Brazil, although there are other important localities within Burma, South Africa, and India.","Meaning & Energy":"Black Kyanite is one of the original stones that got us involved in crystals! We have such a special place in our heart for Kyanites of all colors, but black is by far our favorite. It's still one of the strongest protection stones we’ve ever encountered while also acting as a “great awakener”. As this stone creates an impenetrable etheric bubble around your aura, your mind will begin to slow and relax. This is simply due to one finding comfort within themselves, while also feeling that no threat or harmful energy can breach their peace.","Meditating with Black Kyanite":"Black Kyanite activates our entire chakra column while also helping one realign their entire body and spirit. This can be felt through deep meditation, especially when placing your crystal directly over the affected chakra. We like to take slow and deep breaths as we first begin our session, allowing our emotional and physical body to become comfortable with Black Kyanite’s energies. Once done, remove any thoughts from your head and focus your eyes (while shut) to the center of your forehead. Doing so for 20-30 minutes a few days a week can alter the course of your decision-making process. It will also lead to the absolving of any negativity one may have been holding onto both physically and emotionally."},"props":{"Retrograde":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/retrograde","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Past Lives":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/past-lives","Physical Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/physical-healing","Empathy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/empathy","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Past Life Recall":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/past-life-recall","Aura Cleansing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/aura-cleansing"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/17/conversions/3be153061deafcdaed558760de5f4bb5-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/17/3be153061deafcdaed558760de5f4bb5.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Black%20Moonstone.wav","Chakras":["Crown","Third Eye"],"Planets":["Moon"],"Zodiacs":["Cancer","Libra","Scorpio"],"Elements":["Wind"],"Colors":["Black"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"black-moonstone","relURL":"/crystals/black-moonstone","name":"Black Moonstone","Formula":"(Ca,Na)[Al(Al,Si)Si2O8]","Hardness":{"min":6,"max":6.5},"Related":[{"Watermelon Tourmaline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/watermelon-tourmaline"},{"Morganite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/morganite"},{"Dioptase":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/dioptase"},{"Pink Tourmaline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pink-tourmaline"},{"Larimar":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/larimar"},{"Fuchsite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/fuchsite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Black Moonstone":"Black Moonstone is a variety of Moonstone that was recently discovered in Madagascar.

This variety is most commonly found in mass form and is a very popular material to cut into palm stones, carvings, and jewelry. Other colors such as brown, white, grey, and beige can be found running throughout large Black Opal specimens. Some of the nicest pieces of Black Opal have been pulled out of Oregon although Australia has been known to have an abundance of this mineral.","Meaning & Energy":"Black Opal offers complete protection of one's emotional body and aura. This crystal provides one with an etheric shield against negative energy as well as another person’s emotional toxicity. Black Opal will help one stay calm and relaxed in uncomfortable situations, while also acting as a daily reminder that you're not alone on this journey. Simply carrying or wearing this crystal daily will help one become less anxious and have the ability to break out of their shell. Black Opal can help push us to take on new exciting adventures and act on spontaneous ideas. By being able to just “do” and not “think”, one will not have the time to ponder hypothetical situations or worry about things that won’t happen. We all hold ourselves back in life because of these anxious thoughts causing us to deal with one of the strongest emotions we all carry: Fear.","Conquering Fear":"Black Opal is one of the strongest stones to help one take on the emotion “fear”. This mineral will give one the strength to push through things that scare you the most. They can range from a minor issue like being afraid to swim or watching a scary movie, to more extreme versions like going on a roller coaster or jumping out of a plane. Black Opal is here to provide you with the confidence to get through these obstacles thus resulting in you becoming an even stronger and purer version of yourself. The only way to break through “fear” is to face it head on. Black Opal will push you to do so, while also reminding you of just how protected you truly are in this world.","Meditating With Black Opal":"When meditating with this stone, we suggest placing it in front of you while your eyes are closed and when your taking deep breaths. Begin by channeling the emotions or feelings that are clouding your mind and filling your heart space. Project all of this energy into your Black Opal piece until one feels as if they’ve been cleared and cleansed. Take your piece of Black Opal and cleanse it the way you normally would cleanse all your other stones (Sage, Palo Santo, water, moonlight). Once this is complete, continue to carry this piece with you. All negative energy that will try to make its way back to you will soon be deflected, keeping you filled with positive life force energy."},"props":{"Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Soothing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/soothing","Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Empathy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/empathy","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Compassion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/compassion","Claiming Wholeness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/claiming-wholeness","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/207/conversions/IMG_2314-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/7097/conversions/IMG_2314-1-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/207/IMG_2314.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Black%20Tourmaline.wav","Planets":["Earth"],"Chakras":["Root"],"Zodiacs":["Capricorn"],"Colors":["Black"],"Elements":["Earth"],"id":"black-tourmaline","relURL":"/crystals/black-tourmaline","name":"Black Tourmaline","Formula":"Na(Fe2+3)Al6(Si6O18)(BO3)3(OH)3(OH)","Hardness":{"min":7,"max":8},"Related":[{"Onyx ":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/black-onyx"},{"Obsidian (Black)":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/obsidian"},{"Selenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/selenite"},{"Fluorite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/fluorite"},{"Celestite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/celestite"},{"Black Kyanite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/black-kyanite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Black Tourmaline":"Black Tourmaline, also known as Schorl, is a silicate mineral containing boron and a member of the Tourmaline family.

The green color found within this stone is caused by tiny inclusions of Chlorite and Pyroxene, while the red is small concentrated areas of iron oxide minerals, most commonly Hematite. The word Heliotrope derives from the Greek word meaning “to turn the sun”. In today’s age, the most abundant deposits of Bloodstone are found in India, China, Madagascar, Brazil, Australia, and the United States.","Indian Aphrodisiac":"In Indian culture, Bloodstone is considered an aphrodisiac. Within the culture, Bloodstone would be ground up into a fine powder and sold for a high price. The price of this ground-up powder would oftentimes even be sold for a higher price than the raw Bloodstone material. This makes top-quality Bloodstone that much more valuable.","Historical Uses":"Bloodstone has been revered through different cultures and history. The red spots were said to be a representation of Christ’s blood and thus used as an amulet for Christianity. It was often used to check for blood hemorrhages. It is said that the famous Italian painter Giorgio Vasari was afflicted by a violent hemorrhage and a piece of bloodstone was placed between his shoulder blades to stop the ailment. When this stone is placed into water it will add a reddish hue that will be intensified when the sun’s rays hit it. Ancient cultures believed that it was able to turn the sun itself, blood red.","Meaning & Energy":"Bloodstone activates our inner strength, willpower, and courage that has been masked by fear. This crystal is a purifier of our negative energies and aids to convert these thoughts and feelings into positive ones. Bloodstone helps break the mold of our endless monotonous cycles by helping us aspirate to who we truly want to be. This crystal is a reminder that the only judge of our thoughts and actions should be no one other than ourselves. The direction you choose to go in this life will only be decided by you. Heliotrope provides us with the necessary confidence and fortitude to move past hard times and see the growth ahead.","Great Affirmation Tool":"Bloodstone is a thought-provoking amulet that aids in the process of manifesting our subconscious ideas into reality. These thoughts and emotions have been vastly hidden from the open-world due to their true power and our own insecurities. Trusting in our intuition and allowing it to be channeled through experiences and moments will only lead us onto the path of revolution."},"props":{"Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Courage":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/courage","Confidence":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/confidence","Purification":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/purification","Cleansing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/cleansing","Altruism":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/altruism","Consciousness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/consciousness","Action":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/action","Motivation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/motivation"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/7138/conversions/Bloodstone-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/7138/Bloodstone.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Blue%20Apatite.wav","Chakras":["Third Eye"],"Zodiacs":["Gemini","Capricorn","Pisces"],"Elements":["Wind"],"Colors":["Blue","Green","Purple","Yellow","Gold"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"blue-apatite","relURL":"/crystals/blue-apatite","name":"Blue Apatite","Formula":"Ca5(PO4)3F","Hardness":{"min":5,"max":5},"Related":[{"Lapis Lazuli":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/lapis-lazuli"},{"Iolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/iolite"},{"Lemurian Seed Crystal ":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/lemurian-seed-crystal"},{"Angelite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/angelite"},{"Purpurite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/purpurite"},{"Snowflake Obsidian":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/snowflake-obsidian"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Apatite":"Apatite is a calcium phosphate mineral found in a variety of colors such as yellow, blue, green, gray, and brown.

Blue Aragonite is a very special stone that is here to soften emotional transitions. This could stem from traumatic events that we refuse to deal with, to mourning the loss of someone and not being able to cope with grief, as well as just having trouble getting over a recent falling out in a serious relationship. This stone will become your best friend in times of need as it will “soften” even the most hurtful emotions and events we relive day in and day out.

Carrying a heart stone or working with one in conjunction with Blue Aragonite can have powerful effects when opening the heart space. These stones together will help one have an inner evaluation of their emotional well-being and weight we constantly put on our hearts.

Most of the material on the market is from mines throughout Brazil, although Russia and India do have large deposits.","Meaning & Energy":"Blue Aventurine is a psychic activator and helps one open up their third eye (pineal gland). This process doesn’t just happen overnight, as one must work with this stone repeatedly in order to fully tap into its interdimensional potential. Place this stone over your third eye during deep meditation sessions and you will begin to feel a tingling sensation. This effect will start at your forehead and slowly begin to imbue your whole body. The energy you are experiencing during this time is here to help relax your physical body while elevating your consciousness to new heights. As one’s spirit learns to ascend, the pathway to your higher being begins to be laid out before you. The journey must begin with you, however, Blue Aventurine is here to assist, specifically focusing on enhancing your mental behavior.","High Vibrational Pairings":"We recommend using this stone in association with other high vibration, high chakra associated crystals. One that has constantly been with us throughout our practice is Shattuckite. This superior stone, alongside the euphoria one receives from Blue Aventurine, can completely alter the course of one’s life experience. Meditate with both over your third eye or one on your third eye and one on your crown chakra. The connection these two magical minerals develop will truly help enhance any meditative experience, while also passively affecting your day to day attitude. One will notice themselves becoming more open to change as well as becoming more aware of their surroundings."},"props":{"Mental Enhancement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mental-enhancement","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Interdimensional Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/interdimensional-communication","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Determination":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/determination","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Astral Travel":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/astral-travel","Alignment with the Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/alignment-with-the-higher-self","Angelic Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/angelic-communication","Ascension":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ascension","Attunement With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement-with-higher-realms","Bridging the Spiritual and Physical Worlds":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/bridging-the-spiritual-and-physical-worlds","Channeling and Grounding Higher Vibrations":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/channeling-and-grounding-higher-vibrations","Claiming Wholeness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/claiming-wholeness","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Clairvoyance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clairvoyance","Clarity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clarity","Communication with Guides":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-guides","Communication With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-higher-realms","Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/3444/conversions/Blue-Aventurine-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/3444/Blue-Aventurine.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Blue%20Calcite.wav","Planets":["Mercury","Venus"],"Chakras":["Third Eye","Throat"],"Zodiacs":["Cancer"],"Elements":["Fire","Wind"],"Colors":["Blue","Light Blue"],"Parent Property":[],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"blue-calcite","relURL":"/crystals/blue-calcite","name":"Blue Calcite","Formula":"CaCO3","Hardness":{"min":3,"max":3},"Related":[{"Smithsonite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/smithsonite"},{"Purple Opal (Morado Opal)":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/purple-opal-morado-opal"},{"Trolleite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/Trolleite"},{"Blue Lace Agate":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/blue-lace-agate"},{"Turquoise":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/turquoise"},{"Black Opal":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/black-opal"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Blue Calcite":"Calcites are found on every continent, but Blue Calcite is only found in a few places on earth.

It is a cryptocrystalline silicate mineral and a member of the Quartz family. It occurs in large mass formations perfect for cutting, crafting, and tumbling. The chalcedony on the market today comes from one single region in Turkey. This area is believed to have been extracting Blue Chalcedony since 2500 B.C. The word “chalcedony” itself is named after the ancient sea port of Chalcedon, which is now known as the city of Kadikoy. The blue hue of the stone occurs because of the “Tyndall effect”, which is defined as light scattering by colloid sized particles. The color can range from a light transparent blue to a solid baby or sky blue.","Meaning & Energy":"Blue Chalcedony is a calmer of the emotional body and is here to help one communicate their truest thoughts and ideas. This encourages deeper discussions with the ones you love, which will not only strengthen your relationships, but also help “awaken” their emotional bodies as well. As one begins to self reflect and begin their journey with Blue Chalcedony, they must first work to clear their mind and allow their heart to speak. During deep meditation sessions, place this stone over your heart, throat, or third eye, and allow it’s energies to resonate directly with that chakra. As you begin to slow your breathing and focus all your energy towards your heart space, remind yourself why you have set out on this journey of self betterment. Is it to better understand yourself and your true spirits? To voice your feelings and better communicate with the community? To calm your emotional body and help keep your mind clear? Any answer you have is perfect, as long as you are reminding yourself of this constantly. Throughout this experience, Blue Chalcedony will raise submerged emotions that we’ve grown to ignore and subconsciously avoid. As difficult as it may be facing these stressful emotions, it is important for you to finally do so in honor of what you’ve been through. Every experience you’ve gone through has built the person you are today and Blue Chalcedony shows the positive effects it truly has on your ever growing spirit.","Great For Communication Roles":"When engaging in difficult discussions such as public speeches or trying to better express yourself, Blue Chalcedony is the stone for you. The energies that release from this stone directly help raise one’s internal connection to their emotional body while channelling it into words you can speak. The harshness of the situation is forgotten and the inner fortitude within you begins to shine. Your confidence will begin to raise as you speak up for yourself and create your own “voice of reason”."},"props":{"Motivation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/motivation","Purification":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/purification","PTSD":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ptsd","Psychic

& Origin of Blue Halite":"Blue Halite, also known as blue rock salt, is an extremely rare variety of crystallized sodium chloride. It usually occurs in a cubic form but has also been found as masses, grains, and tiny shards. The galactic color spectrum Blue Halite offers is due to minor impurities of potassium within the salt’s chemical composition. The largest deposit of Blue Halite is located in Saskatchewan, Canada, formed during the evaporation of a large ocean that existed around 400 million years ago. Other important localities include deposits in the southern United States, Pakistan, Germany, Spain, Iran, Romania, and the United Kingdom.","Meaning & Energy":"Blue Halite emits energies capable of unlocking your third eye chakra. The vibrations imbue the mind and will give you a better understanding of your place in this vast universe. The questions you’ve searched far and beyond for can be answered through deep meditation.

Also known as astral projection, one is able to traverse through time and space to reveal higher forms of knowledge.

The color can range from a very light baby blue, to a dark indigo which resembles a soft black. Blue Kyanite was first discovered in 1789 by A.G. Werner and was named after the Greek word “kuanos”, meaning “blue”. Blue Kyanite can be found all throughout the world, with important commercial deposits located in Brazil, Burma, Mexico, South Africa, Namibia, and Kenya.","Meaning & Energy":"Blue Kyanite helps one access their mind while expanding their unique psychic abilities. Your third eye and crown chakra will connect, enabling you to understand knowledge at different frequencies. The easiest way of showing off the powers of this mineral is to simply place a piece by your bedside, or even directly on your third eye before you go to sleep. As your physical body falls asleep, your mind is experiencing its own nightly journey. While you're asleep, your mind is constantly trying to decipher and understand the dreams and visionary details you are receiving. These may derive directly from our spirit guides or guardian angels and be a message from the universe. Either way, the meaning of this symbolism is prevalent now more than ever.

An Agate is a name given to varieties of banded Chalcedony, which is a mineral from the Quartz family. Blue Lace Agate is usually on the rarer side of stones, causing it to be most expensive than most stones. Some specimens, in particular, have a coating of tiny druzy crystals within or on top of the banding formations. This stone can be found throughout Africa and have recently had localities discovered in Eastern Europe.Meaning & Energy":"Blue Lace Agate is all about communication skills and how to make your voice heard. Our throat chakra becomes activated and our voice immediately becomes stronger when working with or carrying this stone. This Agate variety provides inner strength that can renew one's confidence and bring about clarity within. This renewed, confident voice is here to serve you in speaking the truth without using harmful tones. One will not get overwhelmed with emotions when talking about difficult subjects, and your inner intuition will help with providing the correct words in the context you wish them to be seen in. Aside from aiding in confrontation or uncomfortable situations, the confidence-boosting properties Blue Lace Agate provides is perfect for job interviews, public speaking, or even any type of therapy sessions.","Crystal Pairings":"This stone also works well when combined with other communication stones such as Aquamarine, Chrysocolla, and Lapis Lazuli. All these stones help one work on speaking the highest truth while generating the confidence to do so. For someone who is looking to speak what’s weighing on the heart or with a loving tone attached, meditating with Rose Quartz is recommended. This combination will also enhance the calming and soothing vibrations of Blue Lace Agate, pushing one into a state of relaxation and euphoria."},"props":{"Soothing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/soothing","Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication","Clarity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clarity","Confidence":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/confidence","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/149/conversions/9997788B-15C1-4E8F-B449-1BD5C6B2AC38-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/150/conversions/19BAB4C7-E477-454F-AE04-522448BB9D37-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/149/9997788B-15C1-4E8F-B449-1BD5C6B2AC38.jpeg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Blue%20Scheelite.wav","Planets":["Mercury","Venus","Earth"],"Chakras":["Crown","Third Eye","Throat","Heart","Solar Plexus","Sacral","Root"],"Zodiacs":["Aries","Taurus","Gemini","Cancer","Leo","Virgo","Libra","Scorpio","Sagittarius","Capricorn","Aquarius","Pisces"],"Elements":["Earth","Fire","Wind"],"Colors":["Blue","White","Light Blue"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Parent Property":[],"id":"blue-scheelite","relURL":"/crystals/blue-scheelite","name":"Blue Scheelite","Formula":"Unknown","Hardness":{"min":1,"max":1},"Related":[{"Collawood":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/collawood"},{"Spinel":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/spinel"},{"Stichtite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/stichtite"},{"Cherry Tanzurine":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/cherry-tanzurine"},{"Isua":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/isua"},{"Blue Chalcedony":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/blue-chalcedony"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Blue Scheelite":"Blue Scheelite, also known as Lapis Lace Onyx, is a stone that is not actually Scheelite but rather Calcite and Dolomite. When the owner of the mine found the vein, he incorrectly identified it as a Scheelite-based stone due to its UV fluorescence. Interestingly, this Calcite and Dolomite mixture produces the same color when shown under UV light. The fascinating bond between these two minerals is that they both share a hardness of 3, yet for some reason when combined, create a hardness of 5. Currently, it can only be found in one locality of Turkey.","Meaning & Energy":"Blue Scheelite is a soothing stone that can help ground our thoughts and ideas. Dolomite is a stone of the earth that not only balances our entire chakra column but will allow you to look at things with a more sensible outlook. On the other hand, Blue Calcite will awaken the mind and help enhance your ability to process information at higher vibrations. The result is a combination that doubles as a spiritual talisman and an earthen representation.","Meaningful Carvings":"Due to the unique hardness of Blue Scheelite, it is an ideal stone for crafting and carving if done correctly. This is a perfect piece for an amulet or locket around the throat. This will then assist in activating and unlocking your communicative chakra. Our voice is strong when centered and projected in the right direction. Working with Blue Scheelite will help massage this chakra like a muscle and allow you to better communicate your thoughts and feelings. If you cannot find a pendant or necklace, place a palm stone or tumbled piece in your hand when speaking."},"props":{"Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication","Grounding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grounding","Psychic

& Origin of Blue Topaz":"Blue Topaz, a rare variety of Topaz, is an aluminum fluorine silicate mineral that forms in tiny (well formed) vertical hexagonal crystals, as well as small prismatic shards. The color is caused from unstable light that's directly absorbed from the inclusions of the iron atoms. Blue Topaz is the state mineral of Texas, where small deposits have been found. The main commercialized localities come out of Brazil and Zimbabwe.","Watch Out For Fakes!":"Blue Topaz has a long history of being easily faked and sold to the masses in large quantities. Most of the “fake” Blue Topaz is actually very low quality colorless Topaz that has been heated and dyed to remove any impurities. It’s extremely hard to tell the difference, especially to inexperienced topaz customers. We even avoid buying Blue Topaz unless it’s from one of our trusted suppliers and we advise you to do the same. This is definitely not a mineral you want to walk into a gem show or shop to buy, as you're more likely than not to be sold a fake rather than a real. The main identifying factor to look for is the depth of color and continuity that spreads throughout each piece. Blue Topaz’s color should be evenly spread throughout the stone, with no distinctive difference within the crystal. If you’ve ever seen or been in contact with Aquamarine, especially raw, you'll understand exactly what we mean when we say that.","Meaning & Energy":"Blue Topaz helps one connect their third eye and throat chakras together, thus creating a strengthened bond capable of transmitting messages from within and above. One will become both more comfortable with themselves and aware of what their emotional body is experiencing. As this connection grows, you can then easily describe and convey exactly how you feel to the most important people around you. Blue Topaz enhances our mental capabilities and ushers in the awakening of one's truest capabilities. This crystal allows your mind to expand and become hypersensitive to your own personal experiences, as well as the messages one is receiving from beings above. Subconsciously when you begin working with Blue Topaz, it will engage your third eye and allow you to slowly ascend and conjoin multiple dimensional layers.","High Frequencies":"The powers that radiate from this stone will elevate one’s mind to become capable of living within higher frequencies, while keeping their physical body grounded to Mother Earth. Try placing this mineral directly over your third eye each time you meditatie, as one can feel the decalcifying effect Blue Topaz offers. The powers that transmit through this stone want us in contact with our guardian angels and higher self. The beings in this celestial realm only offer up the highest energy that can directly benefit and in some cases immediately change your life for the better. It all begins from within and one must allow this energy to be received. Blue Topaz opens up every aspect of your mind and consciousness so you can attract these higher dimensional beings. As one begins these spiritual interactions, the true journey will soon begin."},"props":{"Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Inner

& Origin of Bolivianite":"Bolivianite was recently discovered in 2018. However, a second locality was found recently in Peru (much of the material on the market comes from the Peruvian mines). This Bolivianite is not to be confused with the original name given to Ametrine, when it was newly discovered in Bolivia. Since this mineral was recently discovered, much debate is still ongoing in regards to its exact chemical makeup and theory of creation. Most signs point towards it being a combination of Serpentine and Fluorite, although some geologists speculate some forms of Stichtite within. This would mean another form of “Atlantisite” was discovered, this being the first time in the Americas!","Meaning & Energy":"Bolivianite is still relatively new to us, so we’re learning more and more about this stone each day we work with it. We can assure you that this stone contains powerful calming and balancing energies. This will allow one to fully ground themselves into Mother Earth during deep meditative sessions. As your internal roots begin to expose themselves and dig deeper into our planet, one will soon notice newly found levels of openness and acceptance. Thoughts and ideas which may have seemed so foreign, will now begin to fill your mental space. Physical energies you may have not known existed will begin to spew out and fuel your inner willpower. Your dreams and desires will now become a priority and all available strength will be channeled into accomplishing your goals.","Jumpstart Your Meditations":"Use Bolivianite to help jump start your day with a quick and easy morning meditation session (especially after one engages in yoga or some form of exercise). Just as your body physically opens and stretches during these activities, one's mind and internal emotional body will do the same when extracting Bolivianite’s energies. Trust yourself and your newly found Amulet to usher in joy, happiness, balance, and opportunity. These vibrations will have a positive influence on your life and help readjust the path in which you're headed. Only you can know what's best for your time here on Earth. Bolivianite will help clear the air of any toxicity that may greatly weigh your course of actions."},"props":{"Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Prosperity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/prosperity","Physical

native to Botswana that has exceptional bandings of white, black, grey, and sometimes blue. This type of agate is considered far superior to all other agates due to the near perfect banding it shows, as well as the limited supply. Being only from Botswana, more specially the Bobonong district, it's very hard for one to get their hands on an abundance of this mineral.","Meaning & Energy":"Botswana Agate is the highest vibrational agate we know of and offers up intense energy that resonates directly with one's third eye and crown chakra. One will begin to feel more in touch with their higher self simply from carrying this stone on them. The channel between ones third eye and crown chakra becomes strengthened when meditating with this stone, allowing one to process, transfer, and understand energy easier. Botswana Agate is the key to opening your mind up to an abundance of knowledge just waiting to be grounded and used towards one's life path. This stone helps connect one with their guardian angels and spirit guides that are guiding you day in and day out. Using this stone in combination with Angelite will help expand your conscious and provide more understanding to the messages that they’re sending. Try placing these stones in your pillowcase to enhance your dreams and provide extreme vividness and understanding to the imagery within."},"props":{"New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/higher-self","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Lucid Dreaming":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/lucid-dreaming","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Angelic Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/angelic-communication","Alignment with the Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/alignment-with-the-higher-self","Ascension":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ascension","Attunement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement","Attunement With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement-with-higher-realms","Bridging the Spiritual and Physical Worlds":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/bridging-the-spiritual-and-physical-worlds","Channeling and Grounding Higher Vibrations":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/channeling-and-grounding-higher-vibrations","Communication With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-higher-realms","Dreams":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dreams","Energy Transfer":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/energy-transfer","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/294/conversions/Banded-Agate-%282500px%29-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/294/Banded-Agate-%282500px%29.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Brazilianite.wav","Parent Property":[],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Planets":["Jupiter","Venus"],"Colors":["Green","Pale Yellow","Venusian-Green","Yellow"],"Zodiacs":["Capricorn"],"Elements":["Fire","Wind"],"Chakras":["Solar Plexus","Sacral"],"id":"brazilianite","relURL":"/crystals/brazilianite","name":"Brazilianite","Formula":"NaAl3(PO4)2(OH)4","Hardness":{"min":0,"max":0},"Related":[{"Orange Aventurine":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/orange-aventurine"},{"Agni Manitite (Pearl of the Divine Fire)":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/agni-manitite-pearl-of-the-divine-fire"},{"Red Jasper":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/red-jasper"},{"Peanut Obsidian":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/peanut-obsidian"},{"Tiger Iron":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/tiger-iron"},{"Uvite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/uvite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Brazilianite":"Brazilianite is a rare sodium aluminum phosphate mineral that crystallizes in the form of radiating prismatic crystals, globular droplets, and elongated rods. It's usually found growing off granite pegmatites rich in phosphate. The color of Brazilianite is an eye-catching yellow-green, with the phosphate impurities depicting the depth of color. It was first discovered in 1944, but was wrongly identified as Chrysoberyl, due to its similarities in structure and color. It wasn’t until a year later that Frederick Harvey Pough and Edward Porter Henderson officially recorded Brazilianite as a new crystal and named it after the type locality; Divino das Laranjeiras, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Since then, this mineral has been found only in Canada, Rwanda, Australia, China, France, Argentina, Czech Republic, and the United States.","Meaning & Energy":"Brazilianite radiates such a powerful and uplifting aura that enlightens your inner core. This area is where most of your personality is stored such as your creativity, sexual ambitions, and purest desires. These character traits will become strengthened and expanded when working with Brazilianite. Your imagination will begin to run wild and offer one a sense of innocence. The freedom to express your true identity begins to highlight your inner thoughts and ideas, while channeling them into a physical form. This is most commonly done through creative arts and music, but can also be achieved through other methods of expressing inward energy. Other forms we recommend are exercising, yoga, and hiking. As you participate in these activities, allow your brain to flow freely. What it decides to think about may be a complete surprise!","Unlock Your Mind":"Brazilianite offers a “sun-gazing” effect on one’s mind. This allows expansion of your brain and gut intuition (commonly referred to as the “2nd brain”). The decalcisfying effect enhances the manifestation energies that Brazilianite emits when simply holding or working with this stone in a deep meditative state. Try loosely grasping onto your favorite piece and staring directly into it. Speak through your yellow crystal as if it’s a microphone with the universe as your audience. Make sure you announce what WILL happen on your life path. Do this daily and constantly manifest these desires whenever the opportunity arises. You will eventually understand the true meaning of provocation and how thoughts are able to transmute into reality. Some may call this magic. We believe it is the affirmation that you are the TRUE creator of your universe and can achieve anything with the focus of your mind, heart, and soul."},"props":{"Luck and Good

& Origin of Bronchantite":"Brochantite is a rare copper sulfate mineral that is formed during the oxidization of copper veins; specifically in an environment dry and containing little to no moisture. It’s commonly seen in association with other Copper -bearing minerals such as Malachite, Azurite  (brochantite can pseudomorph over both these minerals and assume its shape), Shattuckite, Chrysocolla, and even Dioptase. Brochantite can be found in many forms such as masses, plates & crusts, and skinny slender rods (much like Crocoite). The color can be absolutely breathtaking as well, with deep-Emerald  green Brochanitite being the rarest and most desirable. This mineral was first described back in 1824 by Armand Levy. He chose to name it after the famed French mineralogist and geologist, André-Jean-François-Marie Brochant de Villiers. Brochantite can be found all around the world, with major deposits located in Austria, Chile, Australia, Russia, South Africa, the UK, Zambia, Germany, Romania, Morocco, Greece, and the United States.","Meaning & Energy":"Brochantite is a deep emotional healer that engulfs your heart with pure Earth energy. It shows one the power of Mother Nature and channels rays of green restorative energy throughout your emotional body. Brochantite pushes personal growth, especially on feelings or experiences that have left a “mark” on us. These internal bruises have never had the opportunity to fully heal, as we have not given our undivided attention to the trauma. For one to move forward, you must relinquish everything you think is true and become accepting of the change. Brochantite helps force you to focus on the pain, yet reminds you of how temporary it is. The strength you discover as you re-experience these emotions for the last time is a testament to your willpower, drive, and determination. You have the opportunity each day to make a change and better yourself moving forward. Brochantite reminds you of this “superpower”.","Connecting With Nature":"We recommend meditating with this stone outside and allowing a connection with nature to grow internally. Being able to find comfort and positivity in your environment is part of your own personal growth and is one of the most important lessons in life. Brochantite attempts to teach you this through meditation, as well as providing protection of your auric field and emotional body. One should not have to worry about negative energies affecting you, specifically during times of internal vulnerability. If you're still fearful, try adding a few protection stones to your daily sessions, in addition to carrying them on you each time you leave your home.","Authors Notes":"As someone who is in love with Dioptase, Brochantite has equally as powerful energies, if not stronger. One’s heart truly becomes full when holding or working with it. You will notice a sense of inner peace and personal resolution imbuing your body. If anyone is experiencing PTSD, anxiety, depression, overwhelming sadness, or general heartbreak, please try meditating with a piece of Brochantite. It’s one of, if not the strongest heart-healing stones The Crystal Council has encountered in all of 2020!"},"props":{"New

It can be seen in a variety of colors such as blue, green, white, yellow, pink, red, and even colorless. Brucite occurs in low-temperature hydrothermal veins in metamorphic (transformation by heat, pressure etc.) limestone. This crystal can also occur in marble, when it is an alteration of a similar magnesium mineral known as Periclase. Many common minerals found near or in association with Brucite include Serpentine, Dolomite, Aragonite , Calcite, and Magnesite.","Meaning & Energy":"Brucite harmonizes with our solar plexus chakra and helps one access their personal will. Your ultimate desires and ambitions become the center of attention, with one’s conscious mind finally able to understand their spirit’s mission. Often our dreams becoming an everyday reality get continuously suppressed by societal needs and external forces. However, Brucite assists in relinquishing the stronghold that those outside forces have on us, while strengthening our inner being. One’s light body (or soul) contains the secrets of success and provides a pathway to a lifetime full of joy and happiness. All one must do is become more in touch with themselves and follow their purest form of intuition. This action is our soul speaking to us, providing one with answers during the most indecisive times. As one continues to read, listen, and understand what their spirit is saying, they will be better informed on what their purpose in this world is. Many of the “lost” souls in the world struggle with this exact problem and believe in seeking outside help during this time. As that may be right for some people, we truly believe in harnessing the energy of one’s soul power within while channeling it directly into the areas that need it.","Channeling Energy":"Brucite is one of the strongest channeling minerals we know of and can have a direct impact on one’s energy levels. This mineral raises our overall vibration and provides endless rays of light to our etheric body. One will begin to feel their energy regenerate, raising one’s self-confidence and focus to new heights. Brucite gives you determination to take decisive action and make a change to better yourself. This crystal is an extremely potent life talisman that we recommend meditating with. Doing so will only better connect you to Brucite’s energies, which will in turn help you better understand your higher self."},"props":{"Self-Discipline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discipline","Life Path":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/life-path","Living in the Present Moment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/living-in-the-present-moment","Longevity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/longevity","Luck and Good Fortune":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/luck-and-good-fortune","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Motivation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/motivation","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Organization":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/organization","Passion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/passion","Personal Will":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/personal-will","Prosperity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/prosperity","Power":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/power","Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Leadership":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/leadership","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Soothing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/soothing","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Exercising and Sports":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/exercising-and-sports","Creativity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creativity","Abundance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/abundance","Action":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/action","Adventures":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/adventures","Confidence":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/confidence","Decisiveness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/decisiveness","Determination":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/determination","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Expansion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expansion","Focus":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/focus","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/378/conversions/Brucite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/378/Brucite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Bumblebee%20Jasper.wav","Chakras":["Solar Plexus","Sacral"],"Zodiacs":["Taurus","Leo"],"Elements":["Fire"],"Colors":["Grey","Black","Yellow"],"Planets":["Sun"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"bumblebee-jasper","relURL":"/crystals/bumblebee-jasper","name":"Bumblebee Jasper","Formula":"CaCO3","Hardness":{"min":5,"max":5},"Related":[{"Carnelian":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/carnelian"},{"Lava Rock":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/lava-rock"},{"Bloodstone":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/bloodstone"},{"Pyrophyllite ":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pyrophyllite"},{"Sardonyx":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/sardonyx"},{"Pyrite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pyrite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Bumblebee Jasper":"Bumblebee Jasper (which is actually not a true Jasper) is a complex calcium carbonate mineral with inclusions of arsenic and manganese oxides.

Since then, this mineral has yet to be discovered anywhere else on Earth and geologists don’t expect to find another deposit of it anytime soon. This is an extremely rare occurrence in nature that simply doesn’t happen and it should be cherished, respected, and valued for the true uniqueness it holds.","Meaning & Energy":"Bumblebee Jasper is a great life talisman that is here to help keep you “buzzing” throughout your day, even when negative energies constantly come your way. This stone helps you maintain a positive and upbeat attitude through the daily stresses of life, while encouraging you to continue your own spiritual evolution. So often can the societal stress you have placed upon yourself override and suppress your soul’s growth and true potential. This can lead you to eventual sadness and depression as your mind and subconscious become imbued with falsehoods. Bumblebee Jasper will prevent that mindset from infecting you or your aura, and instead will push you closer than ever to finding your life’s purposes. Simply by activating and connecting your solar plexus and sacral chakras, you will become more in touch with yourself and understand your deep emotional body. These sacred attributes housed in your lower chakra system are the driving force of what you do and why you do it. You may refer to this as your “engine”, as your gut houses the most powerful emotions offered in this realm. Bumblebee Jasper will help “oil” your engine and provide you with a smooth ride through life."},"props":{"Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Creativity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creativity","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Courage":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/courage","Power":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/power","Focus":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/focus","Passion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/passion","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Adventures":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/adventures","Determination":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/determination","Motivation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/motivation"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/185/conversions/IMG_1859-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/185/IMG_1859.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://cdn.reamaze.com/audio/snapup.mp3","Parent Property":[],"Zodiacs":["Aries","Virgo","Taurus","Scorpio","Pisces","Libra","Leo","Gemini","Capricorn","Cancer","Aquarius"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Colors":["Silver"],"Chakras":["Etheric","Crown","Third Eye","Throat","Heart","Solar Plexus","Sacral","Root"],"Elements":["Fire"],"id":"campo-del-cielo-(meteorite)-","relURL":"/crystals/campo-del-cielo-(meteorite)-","name":"Campo del Cielo (Meteorite) ","Formula":"FeNi","Hardness":{"min":6,"max":7},"Related":[{"Astrophyllite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/astrophyllite"},{"Saussurite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/saussurite"},{"Alexandrite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/alexandrite"},{"Goshenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/goshenite"},{"Agni Manitite (Pearl of the Divine Fire)":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/agni-manitite-pearl-of-the-divine-fire"},{"Rhyolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/rhyolite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Campo Del Cielo":"Campo del Cielo is the name given to a family of meteorite fragments found in a 2 x 12 mi area (crater) in northern Argentina. The meteor was estimated to have impacted Earth around 4700-4200 years ago. The first recorded mention we have of this mineral dates back to 1576, when the governor of a northern Argentina province used the military to search for a large piece of metal. He was only aware of this material because of the knowledge from the aboroginal people of Argentina, who used this space rock for weapons and crafting material. They found what had assumed to be the natural metal and sent it back to mainland Europe for further analysis. There was very little recorded activity mentioning anything else about this meteorite until 1774. However, little did this governor know that he had actually found an 18 ton single piece of meteorite that was later referred to as Meson di Fierro (meaning the Table of Iron). This name was coined by Don Bartolomé Francisco de Maguna, who “rediscovered” this mineral in 1774.","Legendary Meteorites":"It is believed that this meteorite is among the heaviest single piece of space rock to impact Earth, with the total recovered weight of the pieces so far being 100 tons. Included in that weight is the third largest single piece of space rock recovered in 2016 known as the “Gancedo”. This massive chunk weighs in at over 30 tons and is 90% Iron and 10% Nickel, much like the rest of the pieces recovered from these craters.","Meaning & Energy":"Like all meteorites, Campo del Cielo assists one in the full physical transformation of your own existence, while elevating your consciousness to new, unimaginable heights. Meteors provide an energy that pushes one to completely break down their idea of themselves (and who they are) so they can begin to rebuild the true image of themselves. Campo del Cielo meteorite fragments soar above all other space rocks when it comes to the reimagination of who you really are. You are the creator of your own universe and can choose to do whatever it is in this world, thus providing endless joy and happiness."},"props":{"Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Personal Will":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/personal-will","Peace of

ancient variety of Quartz that has a single terminated point. It is a family of smaller terminations flowing around the face of the Quartz body. This crystal is also referred to as Pineapple Quartz due to its resemblance to the top of a pineapple. The term Candle Quartz was given due to its appearance of dripping wax from a candle. This crystal is commonly found in Madagascar, India, Brazil, and Australia.","Meaning & Energy":"When you see Candle Quartz for the first time, you will immediately know that this stone is ancient. Upon touch, you can feel this old earthen energy in the palm of your hands. This energy is capable of cooling and stabilizing not only Earth’s energy but our own as well. The information we receive contains the true cataclysmic events that terraformed our environment. This volatile energy produced a mass amount of atypical, diverse energy and became encapsulated in the crystals forming at that time. Elements of wind, fire, air, and water combined to create massive calamitous energy which we can draw upon. While destruction and damage occurred, it also brought an environment capable of harnessing life. You can begin channeling energy from Candle Quartz during deep meditation sessions to help reignite the spark of the divine within your own life.","Life Force Recall":"While working with Candle Quartz you will experience massive life force energy that is capable of removing bad habits, altering personal priorities, and in some cases completely overhauling your life path. Think of Candle Quartz as an amulet of rebirth, that reverberates our own energy into motivation, confidence, and self-appreciation. These are all necessary traits that are needed when we give ourselves a “second chance” in life. Whether it be a new career path, relationship, or a long-distance move, it takes every ounce of our being to make these goals able to be accomplished.

It's a combination of a very light ocean Blue Calcite and light brown and white Aragonite . The stone’s color immediately grasps your attention in addition to the tiny crevices and nodules within its structure (some of these can even have a tiny, druzy coating within). Caribbean Blue Calcite is a one time find and our guess is that it will be mined to extinction within a few years. Simply because of the color and minerals within, many miners and crafters will have a high yield on investment. This will cause a flooding in the market, followed by a permanent drought unless more deposits are found. We can only hope that the local miners mine this mineral responsibly and don’t allow greed or profit to take over!","Meaning & Energy":"This stone’s energies are still somewhat of a mystery at the time of this writing, although it definitely resonates with your third eye and crown chakra. Caribbean Blue Calcite is a mind activator and helps one channel their own unique psychic abilities that aid one in elevating their consciousness. While we're still learning more and more about this stone each day, we highly urge you to do the same! During your next meditation session, add this stone to your cycle and begin to draw energy off of it so you can channel it within. One of the first things we’ve noticed is the overall sense of calm and serenity that overtook our physical body. This allows one to more easily “slip” out of their physical body and ascend to higher vibrations. This is a place where you can absorb endless amounts of knowledge about yourself and where you're going. Keep this stone by your bed side for an enhanced perspective of your dreams, as well as an additional power source to aid in lucid dreaming and astral travel."},"props":{"New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/higher-self","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Living in the Present Moment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/living-in-the-present-moment","Lucid Dreaming":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/lucid-dreaming","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Mental Enhancement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mental-enhancement","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Purification":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/purification","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Channeling":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/channeling","Astral Travel":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/astral-travel","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Ascension":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ascension","Attunement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement","Attunement With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement-with-higher-realms","Bridging the Spiritual and Physical Worlds":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/bridging-the-spiritual-and-physical-worlds","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Channeling and Grounding Higher Vibrations":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/channeling-and-grounding-higher-vibrations","Claiming Wholeness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/claiming-wholeness","Clairvoyance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clairvoyance","Communication With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-higher-realms","Consciousness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/consciousness","Dreams":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dreams","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Enhancing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enhancing","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Expansion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expansion"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/3174/conversions/Carribean-Blue-Calcite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/3174/Carribean-Blue-Calcite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Carnelian.wav","Planets":["Mars","Sun"],"Chakras":["Solar Plexus","Sacral","Root"],"Zodiacs":["Taurus","Cancer","Leo","Virgo"],"Elements":["Fire"],"Colors":["Orange","Red"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"carnelian","relURL":"/crystals/carnelian","name":"Carnelian","Formula":"SiO2","Hardness":{"min":7,"max":7},"Related":[{"Bloodstone":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/bloodstone"},{"Bumblebee Jasper":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/bumblebee-jasper"},{"Sardonyx":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/sardonyx"},{"Garnet":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/garnet"},{"Pyrite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pyrite"},{"Garnet in Wollastonite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/garnet-in-wollastonite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Carnelian":"Carnelian is an orange/reddish variety of Chalcedony (but can also be found nearly all black) and is one of the most popular members of the Quartz family. It comes from the medieval Latin word Corneolus which is in reference to the Cornelian cherry, a plant species native to southern Europe. Carnelian can be found all over the world, with civilizations throughout history proving that to us today! Most of the Carnelian specimens on the market come out of Brazil, Uruguay, Madagascar, and India.","Carnelian Vs. Sard":"Carnelian and Sard are nearly identical, with Sard being the harder and darker in color of the two. It seems that the names arise from different cultures discovering and naming this stone. However, both terms are still used today. There is no exact defining characteristic of the two, generally though, the rougher and denser pieces of this Chaledoney are referred to as Sard.","Historical Uses":"Carnelian has been one of the most widely used stones throughout history from Napoleon to the Prophet Muhammed. In Egyptian times, the deceased would be adorned with a Carnelian necklace symbolizing the Blood of Isis and their protection into the afterlife. During the Japanese Iron Age (300 A.D.) the deceased were found with Carnelian amulets around their necks. The 29th chapter of the book of the dead in Egypt is notably inscribed in a tablet of Carnelian. Both Napoleon I and II wore a seal of Carnelian during their ruling. Furthermore, the prophet Muhammed was said to have worn a ring of Carnelian on the little finger of his right hand.","Meaning & Energy":"Among our lower chakra system is a form of energy that defines us as who we are. This energy is housed in our groin area and is responsible for conjuring life itself. We refer to this as our “sexual energy”, but its power goes far beyond the act itself. Sometimes withholding our sexual energy and transmuting it for our own good is more beneficial than releasing it for your own personal gratification. Harness this energy and channel it into things most important to you rather than just people. There are countless examples of great scholars and ideologists that have used sexual transmutation to create life-altering ideas, Nikola Tesla being our favorite.","Creativity With No Bounds":"Creation comes from a freedom of expression with no bounds. Colors, details, and symbolism all flow through your mind and body when working with this stone. These can be easily expressed on a canvas or through music, art, sports, and anything that puts positive energy back into this world. In our eyes that is the true definition of creation. Place Carnelian in workspaces where you or your team harness ideas that turn into a reality. This invigorating stone stimulates our creativity center and pushes our inner child to the surface. This innocent being contains a life force energy capable of bringing anything you dream to light! Allow yourself to release full control and let this inner spirit take over and grant you the truest of experiences that you deserve."},"props":{"Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Courage":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/courage","Confidence":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/confidence","Power":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/power","Grounding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grounding","Passion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/passion","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Action":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/action","Sexuality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sexuality","Motivation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/motivation"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/189/conversions/carnelian-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/189/carnelian.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Cavansite.wav","Colors":["Light Blue","Blue"],"Parent Property":[],"Chakras":["Crown","Third Eye"],"Planets":["Neptune"],"Zodiacs":["Aquarius"],"Elements":["Wind"],"id":"cavansite","relURL":"/crystals/cavansite","name":"Cavansite","Formula":"Ca(VO)Si4O10•4H2O","Hardness":{"min":3,"max":4},"Related":[{"Covellite ":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/covellite"},{"Colorless Topaz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/colorless-topaz"},{"Grape Agate":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/grape-agate"},{"Cryolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/cryolite"},{"Afghanite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/afghanite"},{"Lazulite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/lazulite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Cavansite":"Cavansite is a very rare hydrous calcium vanadium oxide silicate mineral that crystallizes in prismatic crystals and rosettes. These rosettes can be a few centimeters tall and are usually found on a bed of other zeolite minerals such as Apophyllite and Stilbite. Cavansite was first discovered in 1967 by a group of geologists in Malheur County, Oregon. They named it after it’s chemical composition “Ca-V-Si” (CAlcium, Vanadium, SIlicate).This variety was not of the best quality and the hunt was on to find this stone somewhere else. Eventually in the mid 1970’s Cavansite was rediscovered in Poona, India. Beautiful rich blue colored Cavansite sitting on beds on Stilbite created a whirlwind of hype behind this stone. To this day, Cavansite has been seen in only two other locations, New Zealand and Brazil. The specimens coming out of Poona are still of the highest quality, yet very scarce. When looking to purchase this stone we recommend searching old collections, estate sales, and mineral auctions.","Meaning & Energy":"Cavansite activates and aligns our higher 3 chakras. This helps one transmit, communicate, and understand their dreams. The powerful energies that radiate off of Cavansite help attune us to frequencies of higher dimensions, realms, and beings. Placing this stone on your bedside each night before you sleep will help provide clarity and understanding of your dreams as well as the images within them. The meaning behind these images will help one learn more about themselves and what they are truly meant to do in this world. These depictions may be referencing something currently happening in your life or are foreshadowing of what may lie ahead. This mineral can also assist you in finding your own unique psychic abilities. It's of great importance and strength when one is working towards astral projection and lucid dreaming. The connection to higher dimensions will help “pull” you out of this realm and into the another one. The more this channel gets strengthened, the easier this ability becomes for one to master.","Clearing Your Head":"Cavansite is also a great meditation tool for anyone seeking mental clarity and calming vibrations. The soothing feeling that this mineral offers will imbue one’s aura and provide them with a sense of wholeness from head to toe. We suggest placing Cavansite in front of you in order to create a clear line of communication. Let this stone cleanse and rejuvenate your mind and body from all the negativity that surrounds you. Once one feels completely tranquil and relieved of any stress, we recommend cleansing this stone to remove all “emotional waste”. Doing this exercise a few times a week will dramatically affect one's emotional state and reduce daily “mental fog”."},"props":{"High Vibration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/high-vibrations","Lucid Dreaming":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/lucid-dreaming","Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/higher-self","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Interdimensional Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/interdimensional-communication","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Expansion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expansion","Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Attunement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement","Angelic Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/angelic-communication","Ascension":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ascension","Astral Travel":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/astral-travel","Attunement With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement-with-higher-realms","Bridging the Spiritual and Physical Worlds":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/bridging-the-spiritual-and-physical-worlds","Channeling and Grounding Higher Vibrations":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/channeling-and-grounding-higher-vibrations","Clairvoyance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clairvoyance","Clarity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clarity","Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality","Dreams":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dreams","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/210/conversions/Cavansite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/210/Cavansite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Celestite.wav","Planets":["Venus","Neptune"],"Chakras":["Crown","Third Eye","Throat","Etheric"],"Zodiacs":["Gemini"],"Elements":["Wind"],"Colors":["Blue","Light Blue"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Parent Property":[],"id":"celestite","relURL":"/crystals/celestite","name":"Celestite","Formula":"SrSO4","Hardness":{"min":3,"max":4},"Related":[{"Iolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/iolite"},{"Moldavite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/moldavite"},{"Selenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/selenite"},{"Blue Kyanite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/blue-kyanite"},{"Sugilite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/sugilite"},{"Black Tourmaline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/black-tourmaline"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Celestite":"Celestite, also known as Celestine, is a common strontium sulfate mineral that forms within certain geodes. Celestite crystallizes as small prismatic shards that are usually transparent. These shards are very fragile and often break off with very little force from the fingers. The colors of Celestite range from white, grey, green, orange, yellow, brown, and blue. This mineral was first discovered in 1799 by A.G. Werner and named from the Latin word “coelestis”, meaning “heavenly or celestial”. Most of the Celestite on the market today is from Madagascar. These specimens are very pale in color and are often greyer than they are blue. You will be able to notice immediately when going to purchase this stone the wide range of quality and price points.","Rare Varieities":"Interesting to note, a rarer and more blueish-white variety of Celestite has been coming out of the Lake Erie region of the United States. Some Celestite crystals pulled out of these mines are even naturally double terminated (two naturally faceted ends)! The world’s largest known geode is actually a huge Celestite geode. At its widest point, this massive geode is 35 feet in diameter. It was discovered in Ohio, United States in the 1890s when winery workers were attempting to drill a well. This geode is estimated to have been formed during the last ice age 12,000 - 15,000 years ago. Some crystals are over 2 feet long, weighing more than 300 pounds. One unique trait of Celestite is that it's highly flammable when ground into a powder. It's commonly used in fireworks because it naturally displays a bold and bright red color when burning.","Meaning & Energy":"Celestite is a very high vibrational stone that's energy can be felt with just a touch. This mineral works towards activating your third eye and crown chakra while creating a clear channel between the two. Your unique psychic abilities will become activated, helping to see and understand messages at a much higher energetic level. These messages are here to serve you on your life path and provide much-needed signs along the way. Some of these experiences include ESP, astral projection, lucid dreaming, deja vu, and connectedness towards your guardian angels. When you first start working with Celestite, you will immediately notice how much more vivid your dreams are. Having lucid dreams will allow you to understand the images with more clarity. Everything you see in the dream realm is important and has a special meaning as to why you dreamt it. As you continue to meditate and work with Celestite, you will be able to have more control over your dreams and what happens within them. We suggest placing a piece of Celestite next to your bedside so you can better channel its energies."},"props":{"Retrograde":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/retrograde","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Creativity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creativity","Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Dreams":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dreams","Clarity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clarity","Cleansing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/cleansing","Angelic Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/angelic-communication","Attunement With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement-with-higher-realms","Communication With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-higher-realms","Elimination Toxins":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/elimination-toxins","Lucid Dreaming":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/lucid-dreaming","Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication","Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/91/conversions/43b6e0e803249683990e7d68428778e5-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/91/43b6e0e803249683990e7d68428778e5.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Chalcopyrite.wav","Zodiacs":["Capricorn"],"Chakras":["Root","Solar Plexus","Sacral","Heart","Throat","Third Eye","Crown"],"Parent Property":[],"Planets":["Venus"],"Colors":["Green","Yellow","Purple","Blue","Orange","Red"],"Elements":["Storm"],"id":"chalcopyrite","relURL":"/crystals/chalcopyrite","name":"Chalcopyrite","Formula":"CuFeS2","Hardness":{"min":4,"max":4},"Related":[{"Tanzanite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/tanzanite"},{"Chevron Amethyst ":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/chevron-amethyst"},{"Afghanite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/afghanite"},{"Grape Agate":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/grape-agate"},{"Hackmanite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/hackmanite"},{"Muscovite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/muscovite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Chalcopyrite":"Chalcopyrite is a Copper  iron sulfide mineral that was first found in 1725 by J.F Henckel.

When Chalcopyrite is exposed to acid, its color palette changes to deep purple, blues, violets, and yellows. This treated Chalcopyrite is what you will find at most shows and crystal shops, and is commonly referred to as “Peacock Ore”.

This crystal was discovered in the late 1940's and was named after the Chara River in Eastern Siberia, Russia. Although it was faintly talked about during that time, it did not explode into the market until 1978 with the help of Russian geologists. One of the main reasons we believe this stunning stone wasn't fully recognized until recently was due to its lackluster raw appearance.","Meaning & Energy":"Charoite is a multidimensional stone that assists one in connecting with spirit guides, deities, and entities of other realms. Our third eye, crown, and etheric chakra system is truly stretched to its limits when working with this stone (especially when placed directly on the forehead). The energies released from within Charoite instantly activate the pineal gland and allows for a hasty development of transdimensional vision. Through deep meditation with Charoite, one may soon receive symbolic imagery depicting aspects within our present life.","Etheric Protection":"With so much negativity around us each day, Charoite is an excellent source for etheric and psychic protection. We are frequently under attack from unknown sources as well as our own loved ones (sometimes by accident!). Charoite provides a cloak of protection around your entire auric field, allowing only positive energy to pierce and penetrate your soul. When you are in this \"safe space\" your mental capacity should feel widely expanded and your emotional body in a serene state. This is where the true magick of Charoite and you mesh.","Expansion of Energy":"Through deep meditative sessions, one should be aware of the potent energy that Charoite pulls from. This energy has the potential to expand not only your mental capacity here on earth but also your own personal energy levels. Imagine if you were able to use a bit more of your brainpower in addition to showing more love each day. In essence, Charoite helps bring these attributes to life by channeling the most important multidimensional energy; love. Love is the creator of all things and is the basis of life as we know it. Charoite is a reminder that through love, anything is possible."},"props":{"Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Mastering Fear":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mastering-fear","Transmutation of Negative Energies":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transmutation-of-negative-energies","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Aura Cleansing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/aura-cleansing","Life Path":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/life-path","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Self-Discipline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discipline","Bridging the Spiritual and Physical Worlds":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/bridging-the-spiritual-and-physical-worlds","Lucid Dreaming":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/lucid-dreaming","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/323/conversions/charoite-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/324/conversions/8a745604a560dc83b44ad7e08a04466c-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/323/charoite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://cdn.reamaze.com/audio/snapup.mp3","Parent Property":[],"Planets":["Earth","Jupiter"],"Chakras":["Crown","Third Eye","Throat","Heart","Solar Plexus","Sacral","Root"],"Zodiacs":["Aries","Taurus"],"Elements":["Fire","Earth"],"Colors":["Red","Violet","Pink","Blood Red "],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"cherry-tanzurine","relURL":"/crystals/cherry-tanzurine","name":"Cherry Tanzurine","Formula":"Unknown","Hardness":{"min":1,"max":1},"Related":[{"Blue Scheelite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/blue-scheelite"},{"Collawood":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/collawood"},{"Green Kyanite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/green-kyanite"},{"Blue Chalcedony":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/blue-chalcedony"},{"Spinel":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/spinel"},{"Isua":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/isua"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Cherry Tanzurine":"Cherry Tanzurine is the trademarked name for a recent discovery of Quartz with Lepidolite inclusions from Tanzania. It crystallized in mass formations and its hue of color is based on the amount of Lepidolite impurities within. What is so fascinating about this stone is its unique hardness even with it containing the soft mica mineral. It was discovered by Jonathan Bartky on the Massai Tribal land in northern Tanzania. Bartky is involved in the sourcing and mining of this mineral and has his known company known as Ariel Treasures.","Meaning & Energy":"Cherry Tanzurine combines the energies of Quartz and Lepidolite to induce balance, enlightenment, happiness, self-love, and resolution. With a heavy lithium content, we suggest placing this stone directly on your third eye or crown chakra. Lithium is given to patients directly as an ingestible substance to help stabilize the mind (especially in treating bipolar disorder). Its mood-altering effects can adjust our emotional balance and alter our perspective to steer us towards a resolution.","Cleansing Our Body":"One of the more unique traits of Lepidolite’s energies is its ability to align and clear our chakra column. This effect is enhanced when included within Quartz due to its amplification effects. This provides us with the ability to handle the juggling of our emotions while also balancing our polarities. Each day is different, and sometimes there may not even be a reason for why we are emotionally “off”. Having trinkets nearby such as Cherry Tanzurine can provide us with an escape from our own feelings to reconnect back with reality.","Restful Peace":"Sleep is not only one of the most important things for a human being, but its also one of the most neglected and abused. We all struggle with relaxing and calming our minds and fully allowing our bodies to sink into a deep slumber. This is vital for healing and rejuvenating your auric fields and entire energy system so that you may be better tomorrow than you were today. Cherry Tanzurine provides us with a tool to calm ourselves before this important time each day. Having this stone by your nightstand, bedside, or within your pillowcase can have profound effects on soothing not only yourself but also the entire room in which it fills. In today’s age, stimulation is the only word that we seem to know, and relaxing is far from a priority. Listen to your intuition, allowing yourself the time to release and recharge."},"props":{"Sleep":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sleep","Dreams":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dreams","Anxiety

also known as Dog Tooth Amethyst, is the name given to naturally occurring Amethyst and White Quartz in a banded or “V” pattern. This variety of Amethyst is found in the form of masses with the only known localities in the countries India, Russia, and Brazil. Its name is derived from the word that means “line in the shape of a V”. This mineral is often carved and shaped into trinkets such as pendulums, buddhas, eggs, palm stones, and animals. The offsetting colors, as well as the White Quartz addition, makes this combination stone highly sought after.","Meaning & Energy":"As well as sharing the same energies and vibrations of normal Amethyst, Chevron Amethyst is far stronger and more powerful when working with our higher chakras. This variety of Amethyst specifically focus on the third eye and crown chakras, activating and linking the two together. This important channel is useful when attuning and aligning yourself with higher energies and frequencies. Meditating with this stone will increase the vividness and clarity of ones dreams and the imagery within. As the third eye sees these images, ones brain will be able to better understand what it means and the connection it has to your current life. This stone is here to help connect you to your higher self and work towards establishing a permanent connection between this ever so important being. Our “higher self” is the truest and most pure form of who we are. By connecting with this side of you, you will naturally be guided on a life path that suits you. Our higher self pushes us to be the person that we truly want to, not a cookie cutter mold we’re told to fit into. We recommend working with this stone as frequently as possible, as well as placing it directly on your third eye to help activate it instantly.","Crystal Pairings":"When working with Chevron Amethyst, it's important to work with other higher frequency stones to strengthen your connection with higher realms. Some stones we suggest adding to your meditation routine are , Sodalite, Lapis Lazuli, Phenacite, Scolecite, and Tanzanite. Each of these stones by themselves are incredibly strong and vibrate at a high frequency. All of them will help strengthen ones unique psychic abilities, as well as connect to higher dimensions containing lifetimes of knowledge."},"props":{"Spiritual

porphyry (a combination of granular sediment dispersed in a matrix) mineral with elongated feldspar crystal inclusions. These crystals are usually white and are oftentimes seen as overlapping, nearly resembling letters of an ancient Chinese script (hence the name). It’s unclear when or who discovered this stone, which has its type locality (original deposit) found in Auburn, California. It is believed to have been found in the 1970’s, with large quantities of product being cut by lapidary artists throughout the 1980’s. Since then this mineral has also been found in Nevada (USA) and Australia.","Meaning & Energy":"Chinese Writing Stone provides one with a newly found connection to Mother Earth. This divine channel between your home planet and soul is capable of unlocking an extremely grounded version of yourself. As you become more in touch with not only yourself, but also the pure vibrations of Earth, you will notice a difference in your thoughts and ideas. Your entire inner ideology begins to break down and prioritize what's important and what isn't. One will begin to unfold a new found glory of loving life and everything that comes with it. It is through these experiences you not only learn more about yourself, but also what you're capable of withstanding. The true inner strength you carry is on full display when dealing with hardships, whether they be emotional or physical. This should serve as a reminder of the true power you have in this world and how you are capable of shaping your own destiny. For once, look inward for solutions instead of expanding your consciousness outward. All the answers we need to the problems we face each day are already within you. Don’t allow external forces to dictate your place in this world. Ground your vibrations and experience a harmonious resurgence of love and life.","Life-Force Amulet":"Chinese Writing Stone is an amulet of life force energy and is capable of drawing out the true being within you. Through deep meditation with this stone, one is capable of “finding” themselves again and reinventing what they offer this world. Maybe through these sessions one is reminded how much joy they feel when helping others. These and any other changes you make afterwards are a result of the inner reflection that takes place when working with this stone. In today's society, we are over-stimulated with external circumstances, leading to little if any involvement in our spiritual growth. Through Chinese Writing Stone’s energies, you are reminded of how unhealthy that process is and what you can do to fix it. As you begin to shine and break away from the normal, keep in mind you are also becoming a beacon of light for the ones around you. It is through this practice that one can greatly affect the world around them and help loved ones become more in touch with themselves."},"props":{"Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Balance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balance","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Courage":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/courage","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Confidence":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/confidence","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Physical

the Chinese culture for countless centuries. It is also the official symbol of the Chinese Imperial Family (the ruling family over the world's largest country). There is a ton of lore and endless discussion about this stone and what the true meaning behind it really is. Most myths and legends around Chrysanthemum involve individuals falling in love with each other thus creating an eternal everlasting bond. The most famous story depicts immortal lovers in heaven who were madly in love with one another. In an act to symbolize their emotions, they rained down Chrysanthemums onto the new world which ended up landing in the Liuyang river. These petals, along with the help of water and sand, eventually turned into the stone we all cherish today. Another common folklore is the story of two lovers who refused to live their lives away from one another. They held tightly onto each other up until their deaths, with the man turning into stone and the woman into a beautiful Chrysanthemum. This etched their bond in nature, showing humanity that love truly is the only thing that lasts forever.","Meaning & Energy":"Chrysanthemum Stones are powerful life talismans that are here to assist one along their spiritual journey to help better understand your soul within. This stone helps you develop a deeper connection with your emotional body and aids one in finding their life purpose. It's a perfect crystal to work with or carry daily if you constantly feel “lost”. It also helps one not only find their way in this difficult and confusing world, but also resets one’s entire chakra by pushing them back in realignment. This method is usually done with reiki healers (which we highly recommend, granted they are authentic), but can also be assisted through deep meditation with the help of some other potent crystals. Use your Chrysanthemum Stone in association with Aragonite, Moldavite, Quartz, Serpentine, Selenite, or Shiva Lingam. All of these stones promote inner wisdom, clarity, and self-healing energies that will push you towards a path of total transformation."},"props":{"Life

It’s the most important ore for extracting natural mercury and therefore is extremely toxic (we still recommend working with Cinnabar due to its amazing transformative qualities, just be careful when touching any part of your body and wash your hands immediately after use). Its color can range from a dull matte red to a crimson or scarlet color and sometimes even as dark as blood. Occasionally on Cinnabar ore one can find tiny globs of natural mercury which settles into crevices of the stone. This is extremely rare and not only adds value to your crystal, but also amplifies the energies it radiates.","Ancient Societies & Vermillion":"Cinnabar was formed millions of years ago during heavy volcanic activity that occurred near natural hot springs, as well as epithermal mineral veins. Fast forward to 315 B.C. where it was officially discovered by Theophrastos. He chose to name it after the Persian word “zinjifrah”, which translated to “lost dragon blood”. It had many uses in ancient society and was a common trade item from the East to West. The most notable and historically abundant use of Cinnabar was for a certain color of paint coined “vermillion”. It was used for nearly 2,000 years as an ingredient for paint, sculpting, crafting, decorating, and nearly every aspect of art one can think of. It’s use spanned multiple civilizations such as Ancient Rome, Persia, China, India, and all of Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods. Although determined to be toxic as early on as the Roman Empire, Cinnabar was still heavily used in makeup, as well as painted on dishes and drinking wear.","Mercury & Toxicity":"Cinnabar can be found in all major mercury deposits, with the most famous being the mines in Almaden, Spain. These mercury mines have been used for over 2,000 years, dating back to the early Roman Empire. It’s estimated that over 250,000 metric tons have been pulled out of this mine, with most of the entire world’s supply coming out of it. As of 2002, mercury mining in all of Europe is prohibited. Current active Cinnabar deposits can be found in Egypt, China, Peru, Philippines, Mexico, Kyrgyzstan, and the United States.","Meaning & Energy":"Cinnabar is a transformation stone that can push one on an internal expedition of truth, change, and self discovery. It’s potent energies engage our root and sacral chakras, connecting the two and enhancing their external benefits. The attachment to the useless materials around us will cease to exist. All of your remaining life force energy will be turned directly in line with one's true higher self. The path in which you set out on will only become more easily understood as you meditate and tap into Cinnabar’s energy. One will become more in touch with their spiritual body. This will allow our spiritual body to make decisions rather than our clouded minds that are so easily distracted. Another great quality of Cinnabar that one can benefit from is the ability to take control of their actions. This slight change can benefit all aspects of your life, and drastically change the path you take. One’s ability to control themselves, through willpower and determination, will lead them to one of the most powerful abilities of the human mind; manifesting your destiny. This is something no other being on this planet can do, except for you. You are the only true visionary for yourself as no other soul can see, feel or embody the real you. Let Cinnabar’s energy show you the power you have within, through deep meditative sessions that bring to life the “real” you."},"props":{"Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Power":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/power","Physical

Calcite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/green-calcite"},{"Hematite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/hematite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Citrine":"Citrine is the name given to the yellowish/orange variety of Quartz that has inclusions of Iron. It can be found crystallized in any form that Quartz is found in. Its name derives from the Greek word meaning κίτρο that translates to Citron. Some of the most famous Citrine in the world comes from the Minas Geras region of Brazil followed by Sri Lanka and India. Lately, beautiful specimens have been found in Madagascar. However, this crystal can be found virtually everywhere.","History of Citrine":"There is much debate as to the true history and correct identification of Citrine. Multiple civilizations have used the word Citrion to describe any yellow gemstone in color. Oftentimes, these gemstones were actually Quartz, Topaz, Jade, Aventurine, and Beryls (Aquamarine, and Heliodor). To this date, we cannot find a defining period of when the naming of Citrine had occurred. We firmly believe that in many old texts Citrine was commonly referenced due to its extremely high vibratory. Our ancient ancestors were highly intuitive and would not let this magical stone slip past them.","Fake vs Natural Citrine":"Natural Citrine is a very rare and expensive stone with some specimens selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Due to this, a large counterfeit market was created. This group has flooded the mineral world with fake versions, which is simply heat-treated Amethyst or Smoky Quartz. When one is looking to purchase a piece of natural Citrine, be extremely wary of the seller as well as its color and size. The best way to describe Citrines' natural hue is as a faint tint of yellow/orange. Any bold shade or vibrant color should immediately raise questions. Also, be wary of the size, any piece over a few inches should range for at least a few hundred dollars if not thousands (depending on the quality).","Energy & Meaning":"Citrine is a master of one's creativity center, which houses some of our strongest manifestative energies. This area has been known to be the key to not only unlocking our personal will but to also unlocking our truest desires. When one is truly looking for a change or a spark of imagination, Citrine’s energy has no bounds. Grasping this stone each day and letting the universe hear your goals will amplify its energies tenfold. It's not just about thinking, or wanting, but rather focusing and doing. When Citrine brings our root chakra into play, it allows us to bring our truest desires to life. Change is something that we are all seeking, but not all of us are truly ready to work towards it.","Connection With Earth":"One of our favorite qualities about Citrine that not many practitioners are aware of is its deep connection with Mother Earth. When working with this stone our entire lower chakra becomes actively engaged and rooted in Mother Earth. During this experience, one is able to fully absorb the nurturing and rejuvenating energies our home planet has to offer. Next time you meditate with Citrine, try doing so outside; especially during dawn or dusk. Both times of the day are Earth's most potent, with all of her energies open and easily accessible. Even if you are not someone who has intense experiences during meditation sessions, you may find a powerful spark that Citrine will ignite inside of you. This beautiful stone combined with Mother Earth and all of her beauty will have a positive effect in steering your life path."},"props":{"Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Dreams":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dreams","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Creativity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creativity","Clarity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clarity","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Abundance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/abundance","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Weight Control":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/weight-control","Transmutation of Negative Energies":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transmutation-of-negative-energies","Personal Will":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/personal-will","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Balancing Polarities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balancing-polarities","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Luck and Good Fortune":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/luck-and-good-fortune"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/420/conversions/Citrine-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/5723/conversions/Citrine-2-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/420/Citrine.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Cobaltoan%20Calcite.wav","Parent Property":[],"Planets":["Moon","Venus"],"Zodiacs":["Cancer"],"Elements":["Fire"],"Colors":["Pink"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Chakras":["Heart"],"id":"cobaltoan-calcite","relURL":"/crystals/cobaltoan-calcite","name":"Cobaltoan Calcite","Formula":"(Ca, Co2+)CO3","Hardness":{"min":3,"max":3},"Related":[{"Actinolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/actinolite"},{"Wavellite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/wavellite"},{"Fuchsite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/fuchsite"},{"Watermelon Tourmaline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/watermelon-tourmaline"},{"Pink Tourmaline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pink-tourmaline"},{"Mordenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/mordenite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Cobaltoan Calcite":"Cobaltoan Calcite, also known as Cobalt Calcite and Aphrodite Stone, is an uncommon variety of Calcite that has Cobalt impurities. Usually the amount of Cobalt within determines how pink the stone is. You’ll most likely see this mineral in tiny druzy clusters over matrix, although some areas in Europe have unearthed material able to be cut and polished. This mineral was first discovered in the Calamita mine in Tuscany, Italy. Since then, only a handful of localities have been found throughout the world. The most important veins of this mineral are currently located in the Congo, Morocco, Australia, Mexico, the UK, Spain, Italy, and Switzerland.","Meaning & Energy":"Cobaltoan Calcite is a talisman of love that will help one discover their true emotions buried within. This stone helps pull out all the suppressed feelings we hold so dear to us. The relaxing vibrations that emanate from Cobaltoan Calcite will assist one in finally dropping that guard around these precious emotions and releasing them. When one begins this process, many experiences, thoughts, and feelings may be brought up and cause one to feel uncomfortable. This stone is here “hold” you in times like this, and provide as much nourishment and love one will need to get through the trauma. Cobaltoan Calcite will remind you how strong of a person you truly are to continue moving forward each day, even bearing all this weight. As we release this weight, one will soon realize just how much negativity they’ve been carrying around with them daily. While facing these experiences, one will learn to grow from them, and soon realize what having a “cleansed soul” truly means. Each day one will have more space to love and do things that truly make happy. This will help one live a life full of joy and compassion, while also not forgetting where and what you came from. ","Crystal Pairings":"When meditating with this stone, try adding other powerful heart stones into your sessions. Some powerful love stones we recommend are Rose Quartz, Kunzite, Green Calcite, Chrysoprase, and Pink Tourmaline. These stones will all assist in the opening of one's heart and provide one with more love than you’ll ever need! Carry a few with you throughout the day as a daily reminder to put yourself first. By making sure your okay first, only then can you go about helping others along their journey."},"props":{"Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Love & Relationships":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/love-relationships","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Nuturing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nuturing","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Physical Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/physical-healing","Prosperity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/prosperity","Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Selflessness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/selflessness","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Sexuality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sexuality","Soothing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/soothing","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Abundance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/abundance","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Compassion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/compassion","Empathy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/empathy","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Generosity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/generosity","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/223/conversions/Cobalto-Calcite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/223/Cobalto-Calcite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Collawood.wav","Planets":["Earth"],"Chakras":["Crown","Third Eye","Throat","Heart","Solar Plexus","Sacral","Root"],"Zodiacs":["Aries","Taurus","Gemini","Cancer","Leo","Virgo","Libra","Scorpio","Sagittarius","Capricorn","Aquarius","Pisces"],"Elements":["Earth","Storm"],"Colors":["Blue","Green","Black","Olive Green "],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Parent Property":[],"id":"collawood","relURL":"/crystals/collawood","name":"Collawood","Formula":"Unknown","Hardness":{"min":1,"max":1},"Related":[{"Blue Scheelite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/blue-scheelite"},{"Green Kyanite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/green-kyanite"},{"Spinel":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/spinel"},{"Colombianite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/colombianite"},{"Isua":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/isua"},{"Astrophyllite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/astrophyllite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Collawood":"Collawood is an extremely rare version of Petrified Wood that comes from Zile, Turkey. It includes inclusions of Copper  minerals such as Chrysocolla, Malachite, Azurite , and Turquoise. This mineral occurrence was stumbled upon when a group of miners were looking for Gold Ore deposits.","Rare Aquisition":"We at the Crystal Council were fortunate enough to stumble on a few unique pieces of Collawood. Its colors instantly captivate the eye and present a juxtapose of colors that nearly look unnatural. The bold greens and blues stand out against the dark petrified base.","Meaning & Energy":"First and foremost, Collawood emits energies that connect us with Mother Earth while rooting our being into the physical world. Like Petrified Wood, we are able to easily access and obtain information from past life experiences. This knowledge is capable of captivating the mind to alter the course of our true life path. The life force energy that can be channeled through this crystal will expand not only the mind and body, but also the heart. Through this expansion, our intellectual capabilities will begin to become hightenented, while presenting us with reasons why we should stay grounded to the physical world. When we find ourselves questioning our next move in life, Collawood will serve as a reminder of our true purpose. This self-realization must be drawn out from deep within your soul and cannot be taught by an outside force.","Self-Betterment":"The major difference between Collawood and Petrified Wood is the intuitive effects that Collawood can produce within your body and mind. Not only does this special Turkish wood stimulate the brain, it also stimulates our second mind known as our gut. This second area of knowledge contains our own true freedom, artistic abilities, and passion that brings our desires to life. Unlike our physical brain, this area is much less crowded and does not rely on external vibrations to produce change and self-betterment. Collawood is a symbolic tool to bring our own inner light to the forefront of the volatility that surrounds us. These energies provide us with the ability to enlighten ourselves so that we can uplift others in a similar way."},"props":{"Calming and

& Origin of Colombianite":"Colombianite, also known as Piedra Rayo, is an ancient form of Obsidian (Black) glass that closely resembles a Tektite (Hence its Pseudotektie classification). Piedra Rayo translates to “Lightning Stone '' and is believed to have been the “Cintamani Stone” from sanskrit teachings and literature. It was estimated that these stones are around 30 million years old, which is extremely unique for any type of Obsidian. Most Colombianite forms in small ovals and spheres with irregular grooves along the outside that look nearly identical to the “hedgehog” makeup of Moldavite. Upon first glance, you may think that this is a solid, bold stone that is unable to be penetrated by light. However, shining a light through Colombianite will result in the black exterior being overwhelmed by a smoky or yellow transparent color that shines through. Pieces are generally sold by the gram due to their rarity and can usually range from a quarter-inch in size to up to a few inches. Local villagers and tribespeople make a living by hand mining these pieces. There are only a few known deposits in regions of Colombia coming out of the area of Cauca.","Muisca Tribe":"The Muisca tribe is an ancient civilization that formed before the Spanish Conquest of 1537 and was one of the first four grand civilizations of the Americas. This community was also referred to as the “Salt People'' due to their extraction and trading of salt alongside precious minerals to neighboring indigenous groups. They are widely known throughout present-day Colombia as great warriors, energy leaders, and spiritual guides. Their craftsmanship with minerals was unparalleled and they were responsible for exquisite carvings such as the El Dorado Raft, a figurine made entirely of Pre-Colombian gold.","Meaning & Energy":"Colombianite is a sacred stone for humanity and is responsible for reigniting the spiritual fire within us. These ancient Obsidian pieces help unlock our hidden energies to form new transformative capabilities. The change will be induced when meditating with this stone, especially inward when looking towards your auric field. The self-reflective power of this stone is enhanced by its ancient energies which can rarely be found in an earthen stone that is nearly 30 million years old.","Past Life Recall":"Due to the ancient origin and creation, Colombianite can help us reflect on past-life experiences and rekindle our inner spirit. Your soul has been on this planet countless times and experienced more than your brain will ever be able to comprehend. Looking towards external sources can help remove this amnesia that humanity suffers when crossing over to a new life. Meditating with Colombianite on or near your root chakra will provide you with the secretive energy that opens up the mind, body, and soul all at once. Very similar to remote viewing or astral projection, we are able to look upon a past version of ourselves from a 3D point of view to observe and understand who we really are. These experiences help translate certain unique traits that we carry over to our current life. As an example, we may have a hesitation or anxiety towards people or events that have occurred from a past phase in life. Sadly these emotions, if left unchecked, will only continue onto each life unless a correction is made. Understanding yourself and your triggers will help you find out how to overcome them. By performing this deep dive within, you will be able to see the purity of your soul that will carry over for lifetimes."},"props":{"High

& Origin of Colorless Topaz":"Colorless Topaz, also known as White Topaz, is an aluminum silicate fluoride hydroxide mineral that crystallizes in the form of prismatic crystals. It's usually transparent and can contain multiple rainbow inclusions due to light refracting. Topaz is the hardest silicate mineral that's ever been discovered and maintains an 8 on the Mohs scale. Colorless Topaz is widely abundant throughout the world and is the most common color of naturally occurring Topaz. It is widely used to artificially make other colors of Topaz that are extremely rare and valuable. For example, Blue and Imperial Topaz is usually heat treated or dyed to increase the transparency and color. Nature can create these varieties of Topaz, although it is extremely rare for it to happen. When buying any color variety of Topaz it is vital to know who you are buying it from. This is one of those minerals that should be purchased with extreme caution because there are more fake or altered specimens than pure ones on the market. The best Colorless Topaz comes out of multiple localities in Brazil, as well as Australia, Namibia, Mexico and the United States.","Meaning & Energy":"Colorless Topaz emanates a very high vibration that immediately resonates with one’s third eye and crown chakra. As this connection between these two vital points of the mind are developed, one will become stronger as they attune to the energies of Topaz. This important connection helps one process, understand, and unlock unique aspects of one’s spirit they may have not known even existed. One of these traits is the psychic abilities that one will become familiar with. These abilities can range from a simple increase of skill in reading one's body energy, to a more extreme ability like dream deciphering and astral projecting. Either way, it's a powerful talisman that we recommend for all experienced practitioners that want to take their soul to a new level. Slowly add this mineral into your meditation exercise and become accustomed to the unique energy this mineral possesses.","Unlocking the Dream Realm":"When it comes to the dream realm, this Topaz variety holds the key to unlocking and infusing the physical and spiritual realms together. The dreams we have each night will become more memorable as you tap into Colorless Topaz’s potent energy. One will be able to visually see clearer images within these astral experiences while observing more minor details. This is vital in decoding one's dreams as every little thing has a significant symbolic meaning behind it. The key is just trying to understand what exactly our spirit guides and guardian angels are trying to show us. One will be able to absorb all of this and allow it to sink into their consciousness without the physical brain forgetting. Over the days and weeks ahead, certain synchronicities may begin to take place that feel like a minor deja vu experience. That is a major sign of the physical and spiritual realms becoming one, as well as Colorless Topaz having a direct impact on one’s life path."},"props":{"High Vibration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/high-vibrations","Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/higher-self","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Interdimensional Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/interdimensional-communication","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Lucid Dreaming":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/lucid-dreaming","Living in the Present Moment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/living-in-the-present-moment","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Astral Travel":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/astral-travel","Alignment with the Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/alignment-with-the-higher-self","Angelic Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/angelic-communication","Ascension":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ascension","Attunement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement","Attunement With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement-with-higher-realms","Bridging the Spiritual and Physical Worlds":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/bridging-the-spiritual-and-physical-worlds","Communication with Guides":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-guides","Communication With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-higher-realms","Dreams":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dreams","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/363/conversions/Colorless-Topaz-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/364/conversions/Colorless-Topaz-Single-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/363/Colorless-Topaz.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://cdn.reamaze.com/audio/snapup.mp3","Planets":["Venus"],"Chakras":["Heart","Root"],"Zodiacs":["Taurus","Libra","Sagittarius"],"Elements":["Water"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Parent Property":[],"Colors":["Brown"],"id":"copper-","relURL":"/crystals/copper-","name":"Copper ","Formula":"Cu","Hardness":{"min":3,"max":3},"Related":[{"Septarian":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/septarian"},{"Vivianite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/vivianite"},{"Pink Halite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pink-halite"},{"Nuummite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/nuummite"},{"Purpurite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/purpurite"},{"Muscovite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/muscovite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Copper":"Copper is not a mineral but an element on the periodic table. It is a soft, malleable metal with high conductivity. Natural veins of Copper are found all over the world, and with high industrial uses, this element is particularly sought after. It was first reported by Pliny the Elder in 77 A.D. and named after the Greek word \"kyprios\" referring to its original discovery within Cyprus (an island country off the Middle East). Copper is a key component in other minerals such as Turquoise, Malachite, Shattuckite, and Covellite. Copper can be found all over the world with important deposits located in Mexico, Egypt, North & South America, the Congo, and South Africa.","Ancient Uses":"One of the oldest medical texts known to man is the Edwin Smith Papyrus. This text was purchased by Edwin in 1862 and is estimated to be from the Egyptian civilization dating back to 2,600 B.C. This advanced medical journal provides detailed instructions for diagnostic, medical procedures, and aftercare. Within these Papyrus pages, Copper has been identified through petroglyphs as a leading tool in various aspects of the ancient medical field. Cooper was suggested as a use to sterilize wounds and drinking water. A green powder was created from a Copper-bearing mineral (Malachite) and used during various medical procedures. What is even more fascinating is that researchers believed that this text is a copy of an even OLDER medical writing! It makes you wonder how these societies were able to be so advanced so long ago.","Healing Benefits":"Copper is one of the most used elements in our society. You’re most likely in a room with all sorts of copper components. Aside from plumbing, technological, and medical uses, this mineral has special healing effects. Wearing Copper on your body is believed to seep within your pores and help arthritis. In Finland, Copper miners were miraculously shielded from arthritic pain, a common medical issue found within local Finnish miners. Werner Hangarter, a German physician, was enamored by this phenomenon and studied the effects of Copper on the body. Werner and his team developed clinical trials showing positive results of Copper for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis along with neck and back problems.","Native Michigan Copper":"The state of Michigan (United States) has extracted some of the largest quantities of Copper this world has ever seen. Nearly all of the Copper is mined in the upper peninsula and has commonly been named “Copper County”. Industrial copper mining started here in the mid-1800s and at one point, produced nearly 95% of America’s total Copper. Native Americans knew the true power of Copper and mined near Lake Superior from 5000 B.C. to 1200 B.C. These dates have been confirmed through shaped wooden logs within the pit, which is believed to have been used to structure the mines. It is estimated that 1.5 billion pounds of Copper were extracted during this period.","Meaning & Energy":"As we have outlined above, Copper is a healer of not only one’s physical, but auric body as well. This healing element is used as a conductor within crystal grids, orgone pyramids, and your own personal magic. Copper enhances our entire emotional field and properly grounds the higher vibrations around us into a physical realm. It is capable of helping us manifest our truest desires, while bringing about universal knowledge. Copper’s special ability is its process of igniting our true inner potential and connecting it with our personal will. With both of these forces aligned, the shining light within us can burst through to bridge the gap between the spiritual and physical realms."},"props":{"Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Physical Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/physical-healing","Cleansing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/cleansing","Self-Discipline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discipline","Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/higher-self","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Communication With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-higher-realms","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Channeling and Grounding Higher Vibrations":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/channeling-and-grounding-higher-vibrations","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Alignment with the Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/alignment-with-the-higher-self"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/142/conversions/IMG_0514-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/32/conversions/a749038dd57e356547f396c77f6b7007-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/33/conversions/2c3b03cdcf7f07b9c8456162ba475070-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/142/IMG_0514.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://cdn.reamaze.com/audio/snapup.mp3","Colors":["Light Blue","Blue","Indigo","Purple"],"Parent Property":[],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Chakras":["Sacral","Solar Plexus","Heart","Throat","Third Eye","Crown","Root"],"Planets":["Neptune"],"Zodiacs":["Sagittarius"],"Elements":["Storm"],"id":"covellite-","relURL":"/crystals/covellite-","name":"Covellite ","Formula":"CuS","Hardness":{"min":1.5,"max":2},"Related":[{"Grape Agate":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/grape-agate"},{"Afghanite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/afghanite"},{"Cavansite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/cavansite"},{"Lazulite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/lazulite"},{"Chevron Amethyst ":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/chevron-amethyst"},{"Cryolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/cryolite"}],"Origin":{"Meaning & Energy":"Covellite is a very powerful stone that helps one bridge the physical and ethereal realms together. Our minds become open and clear when working with Covellite, helping one attune to the powerful energies these higher dimensions contain. One will notice their own unique psychic abilities slowly becoming awakened within them. Very lucid dreams are a common sign of being able to understand and handle this higher knowledge being channeled through us. This information can be messages from spirit guides or guardian angels, foreshadowing upcoming events, or a sign to make a change in your life. Covellite helps you ground these energies down to Earth and use them along your life path.","Tapping Into Your Third Eye":"When one wants to specifically work on unlocking their third eye and activating their psychic abilities, we recommend laying down and placing a piece of covellite directly on your forehead. Take deep breaths and gently focus on the pulsating effect that will become stronger with every beat. This is Covellite and the magical energy it possesses will enter your body, pushing your entire being into a higher frequency. As one becomes attuned with this higher energy, they will soon have more control over their third eye and be able to activate it with ease. This will also help one in the dream realm by being able to see more clearly and to have more control over themselves in these experiences. When you first begin working with this stone, we suggest you carry it daily to slowly adjust to Covellite’s energies. It’s output of vibrations can be very intense and ultimately even too much for some to handle when starting out. If you continue to have trouble attuning yourself to Covellite, we recommend adding some grounding stones such as Black Tourmaline, Onyx , or Hematite.

This crystal’s physical pattern is completely unique and has large swirls, banding, and orbicular formations much resembling Ocean Jasper. The colors of the stone range from a cream to beige with red, black, brown, grey, and white patterns. Its crystal formation is perfect for cutting and carving. You will commonly find this stone in the shape of squares, circles, skulls, points, and tumbled. Crazy Lace Agate is believed to have been formed between 65-90 million years ago in Earth's Cretaceous period. This crystal has only been found in northern Mexico, more specifically in the state of Chihuahua.","Meaning & Energy":"Crazy Lace Agate is a stone of transformation and chakra realignment. The banding of this Agate (and all of Agate’s) is an overlooked energetic addition to this stone. Banding is a sign of free flow in nature. Life was able to form, shape, and mold exactly how it wanted to in our early ages. This is something that we often lack ourselves; the ability to shape our own life without external restrictions. The pressure from our “loved ones” as well as the common culture this world has developed, can lead one’s own priorities to come last. As you grow each day and continue this extremely toxic pattern, you will never notice that this life has fallen within the hands of every person around you except yourself. This is dangerous beyond measure, and if left unchecked can result in permanent damage to the mind, body and soul.","Internal Corrections":"When finding yourself feeling out of alignment, you should first check internally before taking an external action. Often, we find ourselves incorrectly creating problems in our own lives to avoid internal issues. Crazy Lace Agate is here to channel the power within and ultimately help you make the decision in life as to whether or not you would like to work on achieving your goals. We recommend pairing your favorite chakra cleanse meditation with Crazy Lace Agate. Scan your body with this stone to nullify any negative amalgamations that may have formed within your core spiritual system."},"props":{"Leadership":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/leadership","Nourishing and

This mineral was originally found in the Russian Ural Mountains back in 1766, but was first reported as Crocoite by F.S. Beaudant in 1832. He named it after the Greek word “Saffron”, due to its vibrant orange color. Only small amounts of very tiny prismatic crystals were found in Russia and throughout Europe until there was a major discovery at the Heazlewood lead-silver mine in Tasmania in 1895. The most famous mine in this region is the Adelaide mine, which is still in use today. Since Crocoite’s discovery in this region over 120 years ago, 90% of specimens and crystals on the market are traced to this location. Crocoite is a very valuable and rare crystal with fine specimens selling for over US$10,000. When attempting to purchase this stone, just be knowledgeable about who is selling it and where it's from. Other notable localities of Crocoite currently on the market are coming out of Brazil, China, Canada, and the United States.","Meaning & Energy":"Crocoite is a very interesting mineral that gives off a high vibrational energy. This mineral works to activate, unlock and link your root, heart, and crown chakras together. This important connection helps you root your most important thoughts and emotions down to an earthly plane so that they can then be grounded. Only once you are able to come to terms with your ideas and emotions, can you move forward and take action. The most important step when trying to do this is just taking the initial jump. A lot of people have trouble making the leap due to fear and insecurities, but Crocoite can be the perfect ally. This special mineral helps keep your mind focused and clear when on the path of following your dreams. It provides you with “tunnel vision” to help avoid distractions and derailments from your truest desires. Crocoite also assists you with keeping an open and clear heart space, allowing your truest emotions to channel through you. Being able to use your positive emotions while chasing after your goals will only enhance the experience thus making each and every moment meaningful."},"props":{"New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Love & Relationships":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/love-relationships","Creativity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creativity","Passion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/passion","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Sexuality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sexuality","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/405/conversions/IMG_3116-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/405/IMG_3116.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Cryolite.wav","Parent Property":[],"Chakras":["Sacral","Solar Plexus","Heart","Throat","Third Eye","Crown","Root"],"Planets":["Uranus"],"Zodiacs":["Gemini","Aquarius"],"Elements":["Storm"],"Colors":["White"],"id":"cryolite","relURL":"/crystals/cryolite","name":"Cryolite","Formula":"Na2NaAIF6","Hardness":{"min":2.5,"max":3},"Related":[{"Grape Agate":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/grape-agate"},{"Afghanite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/afghanite"},{"Colorless Topaz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/colorless-topaz"},{"Cavansite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/cavansite"},{"Okenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/okenite"},{"Datolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/datolite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Cryolite":"Cryolite is a rare and now extinct sodium aluminum fluoride mineral that crystallizes in the form of masses and sometimes small cubic crystals that can appear transparent. This mineral can only be seen as colorless or egg-shell white. Multiple different minerals can grow within or off of Cryolite, sometimes making it an entirely different color. Some of these mineral varieties and their colors are Sphalerite(red/brown), Pyrite (metallic/gold), Chalcopyrite (purple/blue/pink), and Galena (metallic/silver). This mineral was first reported back in 1798 by Peder Christian Abildgaard, a Dutch physician and veterinarian. The exact piece he examined was from the famed Cryolite deposit in Ivigtut, Greenland, near the Arsuk Fjord. He chose to name this new mineral Cryolite after the Greek words “cryos” meaning “ice” and “lithos” meaning “stone”. This was in reference to the snow-like appearance this mineral has when looking at it. Cryolite has been found a few other times other than it’s original Greenland locality. A few states within the United States have found very small deposits, as well as Russia, Norway, Brazil, and the Czech Republic.","Mined to Extinction":"The original deposit in Ivigtut, Greenland was declared “commercially mined to extinction” in 1987. This deposit was the world's first and only Cryolite locality for over 150 years. Official mining operations started around 1799 by British engineer J.W. Taylor, but much of his original attention went to the surrounding silver and lead veins instead. As these mineral quantities slowly diminished, more attention was put on the high aluminum content within Cryolite. This mineral’s extraction rapidly sped up and in 1864 was granted exclusive mining rights to one single company. Operations ensued at a normal pace until 1884 when the Hall-Heroult smelting process was invented. This specific smelting process was used to increase the speed and efficiency of extracting near pure aluminum from rough ore. Cryolite is essential for this process because of its ability to melt at 1,012 degrees Celsius. Aluminum oxide minerals (also known as alumina) are dissolved in this molten Cryolite liquid, which in return helps lower the 2,072 degree Celsius melting point of all alumina. This process was used throughout World War II, thus resulting in enormous amounts of Cryolite being extracted from Ivigtut. This single factor alone was one of the main reasons for the United States presence in Greenland during this time. After the war, the mining rights were once again sold to another Danish company, only this time it's occupation would help the entire country. The last remnants of Cryolite eventually went on to help fund and establish what we now know today as, Air Greenland. Cryolite has since been able to be synthetically created and the need for this natural mineral no longer serves the industrial community.","Meaning & Energy":"Cryolite is a very intuitive stone that resonates with all chakras, especially the third eye. One's inner vision will become activated with unique psychic abilities soon to follow. Aside from passively maintaining an enhanced mental state, one may also experience prophetic visions, contact with spirit guides, lucid dreaming, astral projection, deja vu and ESP. These are all signs of the potent energy of Cryolite being imbued within your spirit. As one becomes more in touch with themselves, this mineral helps create a clear channel with your higher being. This is the purest form of yourself that houses one’s entire light body. This higher spirit is the embodiment of truth, love, and passion. As one begins to connect and better understand the messages coming from their guide, they can directly apply it to their life. To work on this vision and fully understand the imagery we see, try meditating with your Cryolite piece placed on your forehead. The potent vibrations that project from this stone will soon seep directly into one’s pineal gland, activating it in mere minutes (very few high vibration stones that we’ve ever worked with have the power to do such a thing in little to no time). The tingling and pulsations one will feel on their forehead may be too powerful for strangers at first. You must learn to attune your energy to it and begin by carrying it with you each and every day. Allow this stone to passively raise your overall vibration, while giving yourself time to become accustomed to it. Once ready, begin to start adding Cryolite into your deep meditation routine and watch this magical mineral come to life."},"props":{"Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Expansion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expansion","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/higher-self","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Lucid Dreaming":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/lucid-dreaming","Consciousness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/consciousness","Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Self-Discipline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discipline","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Selflessness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/selflessness","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Alignment with the Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/alignment-with-the-higher-self","Ascension":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ascension","Astral Travel":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/astral-travel","Attraction":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attraction","Attunement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement","Attunement With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement-with-higher-realms","Bridging the Spiritual and Physical Worlds":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/bridging-the-spiritual-and-physical-worlds","Channeling and Grounding Higher Vibrations":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/channeling-and-grounding-higher-vibrations","Clarity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clarity","Communication With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-higher-realms","Communication with Guides":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-guides","Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/380/conversions/Cryolite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/380/Cryolite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Dalmatian%20Stone.wav","Colors":["Pale Yellow","White","Brown","Yellow"],"Parent Property":[],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Planets":["Earth"],"Elements":["Earth"],"Zodiacs":["Gemini"],"Chakras":["Solar Plexus","Sacral","Root"],"id":"dalmatian-stone","relURL":"/crystals/dalmatian-stone","name":"Dalmatian Stone","Formula":"n{[Na][Na2][Fe2+4Fe3+]Si8O22(OH)2} p[SiO2]","Hardness":{"min":5,"max":7.5},"Related":[{"Schalenblende":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/schalenblende"},{"Imperial Topaz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/imperial-topaz"},{"Red Quartz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/red-quartz"},{"Wulfenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/wulfenite"},{"Uvite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/uvite"},{"Truffle Chalcedony":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/truffle-chalcedony"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Dalmatian Stone":"Dalmatian Stone, also referred to as Dalmatian Jasper, is a white feldspar-Quartz mineral with black dotted inclusions.

You will almost immediately sense an overwhelming obsession for accomplishing all your dreams. As you work with this stone and tap into the powerful vibrations that emanate from it, one will find themselves questioning their surroundings. This is due in part to one’s internal vibration being raised, while also being centered on your own personal desires.

& Origin of Datolite":"Datolite is a low-temperature hydrothermal calcium boron hydroxide nesosilicate mineral. It crystallizes in the form of mainly masses and grains, but can also be seen in globular and botryoidal form. When this mineral is found to be botryoidal, it's commonly referred to as Botryolite. Rarely does Datolite form actual crystals, but when it does, they are generally seen as small prismatic shards. Datolite can be seen in a variety of different colors and can sometimes take on the color of other minerals which form around it (Prehnite , Calcite, Quartz, Copper , Danburite, Epidote). Most often you’ll find Datolite to be colorless, light yellow or green, but can also be white, red, pink, purple, and blue. The first discovery of this mineral took place back in 1806 in Arendal, Aust-Agder, Norway. J. Esmark is credited with this discovery and chose to name it after the Greek words meaning “divide” and “stone”. This was referring to the body of this first specimen, which exhibited massive granular structures. Datolite has localities all over the world, with many deposits formed alongside veins of other massive minerals. One example is the great Copper mines of Lake Superior, Michigan. There is still an astronomical amount of Datolite (in massive form) in this region, even though the Copper has been steadily mined for 7000 years (starting with the earliest of Native Americans in 5000 B.C.) Other notable Datolite localities are Charcas, Mexico; Schwarzwald, Germany; Ontario, Canada; Norway, and Russia.","Meaning & Energy":"Datolite helps one find the light within them and connects their consciousness to higher energies. One’s third eye and crown chakras will become activated, helping you to see and understand the endless realities amongst us. This “infinite” universe allows one to recognize the power they hold within this physical realm, as well as being able to conjure opportunities that one ever so desires. Look to Datolite’s ability to open portals of knowledge between our realm and the angels watching over us. Our individual spirit guides, as well as Earth’s etheric guardians, are constantly providing messages for us to understand the reality in which we’re living in. Take for example the synchronicities one constantly experiences or the deja vu moments where one feels like a specific moment has “already occurred”. The true psychic abilities our consciousness offers our mind are finally realized when working with Datolite. The channeling ability of your own “super” powers will slowly begin to unlock as you continue to attune to this stone’s powers. Place your piece of Datolite directly over your third eye and work towards clearing your entire mind. Slow your thoughts and begin to take long, deep breaths. As the energies of this stone begin to imbue your entire aura, a pulsating sensation should be felt within your third eye. Our soul slowly begins to ascend and harmonize on a level where one can have access to their higher self,thus releasing light and love."},"props":{"Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/higher-self","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Life Path":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/life-path","Living in the Present Moment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/living-in-the-present-moment","Lucid Dreaming":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/lucid-dreaming","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Mental Enhancement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mental-enhancement","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Alignment with the Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/alignment-with-the-higher-self","Ascension":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ascension","Astral Travel":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/astral-travel","Attunement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement","Attunement With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement-with-higher-realms","Bridging the Spiritual and Physical Worlds":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/bridging-the-spiritual-and-physical-worlds","Channeling and Grounding Higher Vibrations":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/channeling-and-grounding-higher-vibrations","Claiming Wholeness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/claiming-wholeness","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/375/conversions/datolite-2-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/375/datolite-2.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Desert%20Rose%20Selenite.wav","Colors":["White","Brown"],"Chakras":["Solar Plexus"],"Elements":["Earth","Water","Wind"],"Planets":["Earth"],"Parent Property":[],"id":"desert-rose-selenite","relURL":"/crystals/desert-rose-selenite","name":"Desert Rose Selenite","Formula":"CaSO4•2H2O","Hardness":{"min":2,"max":2},"Related":[{"Botswana Agate":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/botswana-agate"},{"Wulfenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/wulfenite"},{"Imperial Topaz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/imperial-topaz"},{"Caribbean Blue Calcite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/caribbean-blue-calcite"},{"Magnetite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/magnetite"},{"Chrysanthemum Stone":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/chrysanthemum-stone"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Desert Rose Selenite":"Desert Rose Selenite, also known as Gypsum Rose or Sand Rose, is a type of Selenite formed from a combination of water, wind, and sand. Sand becomes embedded in Selenite blades, while additions of water overtime help form the signature “rosette” formation. Most specimens on the market have been brushed lightly with a torch to help define these rose petal shapes, though it does not affect the energy of these stones. These tend to be formed over a couple of hundred years, rather than like a majority of crystals and minerals which have formed millions, and sometimes billions of years ago. Desert Rose Selenite is commonly found in most deserts around the world in countries such as Mexico, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Tunisia, and Afghanistan. There is a particular type of Desert Rose Selenite found only in Oklahoma that formed around 250 million years ago when a shallow sea covered the current state (it's locally called “Gerber Sandstone”). Most specimens are very fragile and should be held with great caution!","Meaning & Energy":"Desert Rose Selenite is the perfect meditation tool that helps one stay grounded and balanced. This mineral actives our root, crown, and sacral chakras that assist in mental clarity and focus, manifestation, and self-expression, and unlocking our divine will. It's the perfect stone to place at your bedside, workspace, or meditation room as it helps cleanse one's aura and environment. Due to it mainly being Selenite based, it will charge and cleanse other crystals when placed around them. Desert Rose is a stone for anyone who feels as though they need a constant rejuvenation of energy. They work on a very high, energetic vibration that helps realign one’s chakra system. Removing blockages between chakras will help ease the flow of energy within."},"props":{"Clearing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clearing","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Expansion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expansion","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Enhancing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enhancing","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Energy Transfer":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/energy-transfer","Elimination Toxins":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/elimination-toxins","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Clarity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clarity","Channeling":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/channeling","Aura Cleansing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/aura-cleansing","Abundance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/abundance","Action":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/action","Mental Health":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mental-health-1","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Prosperity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/prosperity","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Intention Enhancement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intention-enhancement","Cleansing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/cleansing","Balance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balance","Mental Enhancement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mental-enhancement","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/165/conversions/IMG_0184-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/165/IMG_0184.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Diopside.wav","Parent Property":[],"Colors":["Pale Yellow","Venusian-Green","Brown","Grey","Black","Olive Green ","Yellow","Green"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Zodiacs":["Libra","Virgo"],"Elements":["Earth"],"Planets":["Earth"],"Chakras":["Root","Heart"],"id":"diopside","relURL":"/crystals/diopside","name":"Diopside","Formula":"CaMgSi2O6","Hardness":{"min":6,"max":6},"Related":[{"Vesuvianite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/vesuvianite"},{"Garnierite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/garnierite"},{"Pargasite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pargasite"},{"Actinolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/actinolite"},{"Axinite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/axinite"},{"Chiastolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/chiastolite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Diopside":"Diopside is a magnesium calcium metamorphic silicate mineral that crystallizes in the form of grainy masses and small prismatic (twinning) shards. It is a member of the Pyroxene group of minerals and was first discovered by Jose Bonifacio de Andrada e Silva in 1806 (he is also credited for finding Andradite, Petalite, and Spodumene). He chose to name it after the Greek word “dis” meaning double, “opse” meaning face. This was chosen in reference to it’s growing habit which can occasionally form duel prismatic crystal faces. Diopside is primarily found in any variety shades of green, but can also occur as white, brown, yellow, grey or black. The black variety often has a “star” effect when cut at the right angle. This star effect is called Asterism, and is an optical phenomenon created by concentrations of reflected light.","Rare To Find":"Diopside is very hard to find on the mineral market, which has caused a huge demand allowing for largely inflated prices to occur. Small crystal specimens can start at around $500 and only increase depending on the clarity and colors it exhibits. When looking to purchase a piece of Diopside, we recommend doing your research and finding a reliable, suitable dealer who is extremely transparent. The best specimens we’ve ever encountered have been from Siberia, China, Russia, South Africa, Brazil, and various localities throughout the US.","Chrome Diopside":"Chrome Diopside is an even rarer form of Diopside and is one of the most important minerals for discovery and other geological work. The compound inclusions of Chromium within Diopside give it that lustery rich green color that nearly makes it look fake. These enhanced Diopside specimens are almost always found as precursors to the mineral Kimberlite. Kimberlite is an igneous rock and the most important source of Diamonds. They are believed to have been formed within the Earth’s mantle, some 90-275 miles deep within our home planet. Volcanic and cataclysmic activity pushed fragments through the crust and onto the surface, giving us all an opportunity to harness the energy of Inner Earth.","Meaning & Energy":"Diopside is a stone of eternal enlightenment and healing, providing one pure restorative energy for each and every lifetime they endured. The building blocks of life force energy reside within Diopside and are part of the reason why spiritual practitioners adore the energy it outputs. The vibratory effects resonate deep within our soul, penetrating the limits our mind can no longer comprehend. It is within this layer of our being which houses the past life experience we’ve absorbed and have been a part of. When something is truly traumatizing and resonates directly with your core, that emotion becomes solidified in your mind and body. Through time (albeit a lifetime) the memory will perish from the mind, but become embedded in our core. As your soul progresses and moves forward through another dimensional experience, that scar becomes immortalized and internalized. These are defining characteristics of what eventually become the foundation and allow for you to be exactly who you are right now. Diopside reads, channels and directs this information outwards and grants one a rare opportunity into their past. Through deep meditation with a piece placed directly over the heart, one must work to relinquish the protective control we subconsciously placed on our emotional body. Through this, visionary experiences may take place over the days and weeks to come as you enrich yourself in the energies of Diopside. As our consciousness becomes more connected to a grounded, more planetary vibration, so do the dreams that you experience nightly. These experiences are all happening and channeling into your consciousness for a reason, and can only be understood and “decoded” by you or an extremely connected individual, such as a channeler, scribe, or even an extremely powerful reiki healer."},"props":{"New

Dioptase is one of the rarest stones on the market and has only a few known localities in the entire world. The highest quality Dioptase ever recorded has come out of Tsumeb, Namibia. Tsumeb is deemed the most important deposit of this mineral, however the second important location is the original place of discovery, Karaganda Region, Kazakhstan. The entire state of Arizona, located in the United States, has numerous active mines pulling out Dioptase. Our favorite is the Christmas Mine in Gila County because the clarity of crystals and near perfect structure make this a must have for any stone lover.","Meaning & Energy":"Dioptase is a vibrant talisman of the heart that can help one relinquish extremely sensitive emotions such as grief, trauma, depression, anxiety, and self-hate. This special mineral exposes one’s heart and brings about soothing waves of life force energy that helps “reset” one’s emotional body. Each day this stone will pull out more strength from one’s body that may have gone dormant. This strength will eventually become so overwhelming that it will naturally raise one's self confidence and courage levels, forcing you to take action and make a change. This change can be something as small as removing a bad habit from your lifestyle or taking on a new activity that will help you grow on the path you ever so desire.","Understand Emotional Pain":"We strongly recommend this crystal for anyone struggling with emotional pain. Sometimes one must understand that the answer isn’t physical and the change isn’t instant. Dioptase will teach you that vital lesson, along with life’s most important tool, patience. This mineral is very rare and hard to come by, just know that whenever Dioptase comes into your life, it is for a very special reason. Purchase this stone if possible and begin to work with it immediately. Its energies can be felt to the touch with a cool, calming sensation slowly overtaking one’s body."},"props":{"Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Life

Rock":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/lava-rock"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Dolomite":"Dolomite is a calcium, magnesium, carbonate mineral that commonly forms in small clusters of rhomehedrical shaped crystals with saddle-shaped formations. This mineral can also be found in masses or grains and appears as white, grey, brown, green, pink and black. The first traces of Dolomite in historical writings were by the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus in 1778. However, this mineral was named in honor of the French geologist Déodat de Dolomieu in 1791.","Meaning & Energy":"Dolomite invigorates our entire chakra system while grounding our emotions into the physical realm. If you often find yourself out of balance, Dolomite's energies focus on centering our emotional and physical bodies. This mineral harnesses its element by rooting one's aura deep into the core of the earth. Here, we can tap into Mother Earth's energies and intentions so that we may begin to reprogram our chakra system to be fully aligned once more. If you are one that is eager to clear your headspace of unneeded, self-deprecating thoughts and would like to tap into Mother Earth’s energies for guidance, Dolomite is a stone that you should be working with. When one is fully aligned with their chakra system, their decisions and thoughts will be of pure and decisive intent.","Meditating With Dolomite":"We recommend working with this stone to scan over your chakra system. A common practice would be to lie down with Dolomite resting over your center. Starting at the bottom, work your way to the top, targeting each chakra and working with this stone to clear it of any negative energy. Dolomite works in clearing that unwanted toxicity in each of your chakras so that you may begin to feel centered once more.","Dolomite With Other Stones":"Dolomite is commonly found alongside other stones. We’ve seen it often growing in conjunction with grounding stones such as Sphalerite, Galena, and Magnetite. When Dolomite is paired with a deep root chakra stone, it assists in balancing out the energies while granting the user with powerful strengthening vibrations. Dolomite’s earth element matched with a grounding stone will result in an almost unstoppable energy force. Other times, Dolomite is found alongside other high vibrational stones such as Phenacite, Moldavite, Quartz, or Herkimer Diamond. When this occurs, it is there to help even out the intense energies a stone may have and make it easier for us to interpret the energies we may be receiving."},"props":{"Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Balance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balance","Grounding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grounding","Weight Control":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/weight-control","Breaking Addictions":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/breaking-addictions","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Balancing Polarities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balancing-polarities"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/114/conversions/fef4b831f05e867dbef16928ad1b073e-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/6519/conversions/dolomite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/114/fef4b831f05e867dbef16928ad1b073e.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Dragi%20(Dragon)%20Jade.wav","Parent Property":[],"Planets":["Earth"],"Elements":["Earth"],"Zodiacs":["Aries","Taurus","Gemini","Libra"],"Colors":["Green","Olive Green "],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Chakras":["Heart"],"id":"dragi-(dragon)-jade","relURL":"/crystals/dragi-(dragon)-jade","name":"Dragi (Dragon) Jade","Formula":"n[NaAlSi2O6] p[Ca2(Mg, Fe)5Si8O22(OH)2","Hardness":{"min":6,"max":6.5},"Related":[{"Yellow Jade":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/yellow-jade"},{"Moss Agate":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/moss-agate"},{"Actinolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/actinolite"},{"Nundoorite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/nundoorite"},{"Brochantite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/brochantite"},{"Mangano Calcite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/mangano-calcite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Dragon Jade":"Dragi Jade is a variety of Nephrite.

Due to how new this stone actually is, you may find it sold under a multitude of different names. The best way to uncover what it is you're buying is to understand the physical stone. The weight, color, size, and even price (occasionally) can help one fully identify what it is they’re purchasing.","Meaning & Energy":"Dragi Jade shares the same energies as other Jade found throughout the world. These energies include powerful vibrations that resonate with our heart space. More importantly, Jade and the symbol of the dragon, have been revered as protection totems throughout history. When meditating with this stone, imagine the ferocity of a dragon protecting your aura. Jade is a stone that will take those negative energies and transmute them into loving vibrations that your heart can then benefit from.","New, Mysterious Vibrations...":"The only major difference we’ve noticed is the strong vibrations it carries, even on some of the more lightly colored pieces.

Gustav Tschermak, who was a professor of Mineralogy and Petrography at the University of Vienna, coined the term “Dravite”.Its color ranges from dark brown, to a light brown-yellow with semi-translucent crystals almost resembling Smoky Quartz. The best, and presumably rarest Dravite specimens come from the mines located in Yinnietharra, Australia. Other localities include mainly Brazil, Mexico, and Canada.","Meaning & Energy":"Dravite is a very strong grounding stone that raises one’s stamina, life force, and protective energies. Our root and heart chakras become open and active when working with or carrying Dravite daily. As your heart begins to open, this stone shows that its okay to allow such feelings and emotions to flow freely throughout your body. This stone is here to calm and soothe your mind so that you may think and act with a level head. Dravite urges us to fully root down into the physical plane with an open heart that is eager to love, yet always protected. Its a very protective stone over your aura, and provides a barrier between other people’s energy and your own. We recommend carrying this with you if you know your going into an environment where there may be a lot of sick people or even strangers.","Crystal Pairings":"Combining Dravite and Rose Quartz in meditation will enhance the rejuvenating and healing energies on ones heart. This combination provides emotional healing and gentle release of all bound up stress within. Trying placing the Rose Quartz over your heart when meditating to feel its vibrations even more. By combining Moldavite with Dravite, one will begin a very transformative experience. Moldavite has been known as one of the strongest heart stones, and is a perfect ally when trying to open up and heal.

It only occurs on Earth’s lower crust and upper mantle (18-28 miles down), and under temperatures that exceed 1200-1800 degrees Fahrenheit. Eclogite has only a few known localities in the world, making this an incredibly rare and valuable stone. Norway has an abundance of this mineral but China, Germany, Austria, and the United States also have Eclogite with different sub minerals in it. The oldest locality that this mineral is found in is Brazil and Mali, with these deposits estimated at over 650 million years old.","Meaning & Energy":"Eclogite activates our lower 4 chakras and strengthens the connection we have to Mother Earth. One’s personal will can become unlocked and then link directly to your heart space. Once established, this channel is here to highlight your deepest desires and take action to make them a reality.

If you're looking for assistance with manifestation, try accessing the vibrations of Pyrite, Wulfenite, Vanadinite, Tiger Eye or Citrine. Lastly, to build a stronger connection with Mother Nature, attune your energies to Green Calcite, Petrified Wood, Prehnite , Serpentine or .

pattern of terminations that flow throughout the face and body of the crystal. Finding a clear Elestial Quartz is rather uncommon, so you will more often than not see it as a Smoky Quartz. In addition, Fenster Quartz is a specific variety of clear Elestial Quartz. These minerals are often found in Brazil, Madagascar, Africa, and the United States.","Meaning & Energy":"Elestial Quartz acts as a window into the spiritual world, linking our conscious body and spiritual mind to the universe. This stone acts as a hyperspeed portal, quickly opening your third eye to a higher dimension. Due to this stone being a Quartz variety, our chakra system has a natural tendency to realign itself back into harmony. This harmonious vibration quickens the activation of our spiritual connection and allows one to intercept higher vibrational messages. The natural enhancing power of this Elestial Quartz makes it that much more powerful. For beginners, we recommend balancing this stone's powerful energy with a grounding crystal such as Garnet, Hematite, or Galena.","Higher Vibrations":"This mineral's extremely high vibrations will captivate you the moment you lay your eyes on it. The knowledge encased in this stone is here to assist you in your ancient origin search. Meditating with this piece will link your third eye to a vast library of knowledge and history. Elestial Quartz can provide insight into our past lives and the events that shaped us. Only when we learn from these events can we truly move on from them. This crystal's repeating faces remind us of an infinite multi-verse of repeating opportunities and outcomes that we may experience. Elestial Quartz helps guide us through this labyrinth of information so that we can come out as a better and stronger-willed person on the other side."},"props":{"Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","High Vibration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/high-vibrations","Past Lives":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/past-lives","Past Life Recall":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/past-life-recall","Synchronicity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/synchronicity","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Interdimensional Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/interdimensional-communication","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Alignment of Chakra":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/alignment-of-chakra","Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/higher-self","Expansion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expansion","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Empathy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/empathy","Clairvoyance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clairvoyance","Bridging the Spiritual and Physical Worlds":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/bridging-the-spiritual-and-physical-worlds","Channeling":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/channeling","Chakra Cleansing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/chakra-cleansing","Attunement With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement-with-higher-realms","Astral Travel":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/astral-travel","Ascension":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ascension","Angelic Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/angelic-communication","Ancient Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ancient-knowledge"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/6892/conversions/Elestial-Quartz-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/6892/Elestial-Quartz.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://cdn.reamaze.com/audio/snapup.mp3","Planets":["Venus"],"Chakras":["Heart"],"Zodiacs":["Aries","Taurus","Gemini"],"Elements":["Water"],"Colors":["Green"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"emerald-","relURL":"/crystals/emerald-","name":"Emerald ","Formula":"Be3Al2(SiO3)6","Hardness":{"min":8,"max":8},"Related":[{"Kunzite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/kunzite"},{"Chrysanthemum Stone":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/chrysanthemum-stone"},{"Green Tiger Eye":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/green-tiger-eye"},{"Yellow Opal":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/yellow-opal"},{"Brochantite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/brochantite"},{"Green Tourmaline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/green-tourmaline"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Emerald":"Emerald is a green form of Beryl that crystallizes in the form of masses and prismatic crystals. This stone was at one point named Smaragdus which translates to Emerald. The word Emerald translates to green stone. It is theorized that many green stones in the past were commonly mislabeled as Emerald. The finest Emerald the world has ever seen comes from the beautiful country of Columbia. Emerald from this locality contains some of the purest Chromium/Vanadium pigment inclusions that give this gem a deep green glow. You can also find Emerald commonly in Brazil, Russia, Africa, Egypt, and Australia.","Historical Uses":"Due to Emerald’s distinctive colors, it has been highly soft after and used within our society since the birthplace of our race. The Emerald Tablets of Toth is an alchemical book believed to contain some of earth's oldest secrets for knowledge and power. This book was carved out of Emerald. King Solomon was given four rings of power by God, one of those being a green Emerald. Ancient natives from New Granada (Northern South America) burned offerings of Emeralds to their sun and moon gods, as they believed that they must enjoy their sight if mere mortals do as well. One of the largest pieces ever recorded was discovered in 1967 in Gachalá, a small town in Columbia. This “Gachalá Emerald'' weighed over 858 carats and is located at the Smithsonian in the United States. As far back as 1242, it was believed that a snake cannot look upon an Emerald without losing its eyesight.","Meaning & Energy":"Emerald is a stone that represents free-flowing energy and directly empowers our heart center. This variety of Beryl contains pure forms of love, compassion, sensuality, and healing. This desired mineral harnesses our true emotional body and is capable of projecting this representation into the physical realm. Our heart space is capable of containing only so much emotion that we must self-release the unnecessary attachments. However good or bad an experience might have been, if you are unable to release it, then that means your emotions are holding you back. This “tight grip” is due to the fear of facing the emotional rollercoaster that this experience incites."},"props":{"Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Love & Relationships":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/love-relationships","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Power":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/power","Physical Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/physical-healing","Purification":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/purification","Consciousness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/consciousness","Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Abundance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/abundance","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Mental Enhancement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mental-enhancement","Unity of Heart and Will":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/unity-of-heart-and-will","Compassion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/compassion"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/6896/conversions/Emerald-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/6897/conversions/Emerald-%281%29-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/6896/Emerald.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Epididymite.wav","Parent Property":[],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Colors":["White"],"Zodiacs":["Aquarius"],"Elements":["Earth"],"Planets":["Earth"],"Chakras":["Etheric","Crown"],"id":"epididymite","relURL":"/crystals/epididymite","name":"Epididymite","Formula":"Na2Be2Si6O15•H2O","Hardness":{"min":6,"max":7},"Related":[{"Blue Chalcedony":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/blue-chalcedony"},{"Goshenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/goshenite"},{"Tektite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/tektite"},{"Pinolith (Pinolite)":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pinolith-pinolite"},{"Danburite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/danburite"},{"Rwanda Amethyst":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/rwanda-amethyst"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Epididymite":"Epididymite is a rare sodium beryllium silicate that crystallizes in the form of masses, aggregates, and tiny prismatic crystals. It's most commonly found in a white to colorless shade, but can also be seen in brighter colors such as purple, violet, yellow, grey, green, and light blue. Epididymite was first discovered back in 1893 by a man named G. Flink. He was on the Island of Aro, Langesundfiord, Norway, and chose to name this newly discovered mineral after the Greek words “epi” meaning “near”; and “didymos'' meaning “twin”. This was due in part to it’s dimorphous (existing in two different forms) relationship with another mineral called Eudidymite. Since this initial discovery, Epididymite has only been found in a few other localities throughout the entire world. The four major countries that host these deposits are Greenland, Russia, Norway, and Canada.","Meaning & Energy":"Epididymite is a stone of ascension that directly resonates and forms a harmonious bond with one’s crown and etheric chakras. This connection helps unlock and form a newly strengthened bond to your higher being. This will assist in the attunement to dimensions that are much more complex than ours. The vibrations and waves that pulsate from Epididymite make this a one of a kind mineral with powers that require deep understanding. One must work with this stone thoroughly and do deep meditative research to fully grasp the energy that this crystal possesses. For example, one’s psychic abilities not only become activated, but also enhanced with each encounter you have with Epididymite. One will not only have more control of their dreams, but also absorb more of the knowledge and imagery they see throughout these nightly experiences. Each detail we see is a representation of yourself and your own personal journey that you are experiencing. By working with this stone, one will have a better understanding of who exactly they are and the purpose of your existence on this Earth.","Crystal Pairings":"We do recommend a grounding stone for individuals who are extremely energy sensitive or are beginner practitioners. All of the energy from Epididymite resonates directly in one’s head and can be too much at times. Signs of this may be a slight headache, fatigue, lightheadedness, or slight mental stress. To avoid as much of this as possible, place grounding stones around you or on you if you are carrying stones throughout the day. This will help not only your physical but your emotional body as well. One can work freely with Epididymite without the fear of a negative experience, while still learning how to harness and channel this unique stone’s energies within. Some grounding stones that we recommend include Black Tourmaline, Petrified Wood, Hematite, Garnet, and Galena."},"props":{"Longevity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/longevity","Physical

It's a member of the Vivianite family and usually occurs around other Cobalt varieties. It can also be associated with natural Silver. The color is mainly crimson red, but can also be seen as purple, pink, peach, and grey. Lighter color Erythrite usually indicates higher levels of Nickel. This mineral was first discovered in Saxton, Germany in 1832 by François Sulpice Beaudant. He chose to name it after the Greek word “Erythros”, meaning “red”, which was the color of the first specimen he discovered. Erythrite is very abundant and can be found all across the world in places like Australia, Austria, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Mexico and the United States.","Meaning & Energy":"Erythrite is a stone that helps the entire chakra column while assisting with energy flow throughout the body. The result of this total realignment is that it ultimately strengthens one's inner balance. This mineral helps identify areas that are in vital need of self healing rays. This can be a trait, physical injury or even an emotional reaction. Once identified, Erythrite is able to channel and release pulsating energy that can assist in one’s overall recovery. Try placing this stone directly over the affected area, close your eyes and begin to calm your mind. Focus on the exact point of overall pain and envision red energy rays seeping through your pores and imbuing your body. Continue maintaining a clear head and imagine this energy slowly beginning to circulate throughout your body. One may begin to feel a sense of warmth and comfort as Erythrite’s energy goes to work. Do this in 20-30 minute sessions a few times a week or as often as you feel necessary. One will be able to self rejuvenate and consistently maintain vital life force energy within. We recommend this stone to all practitioners, no matter the level of skill or experience one holds.","Using Aragonite With Erythrite":"Aragonite  is a crystal we recommend using in conjunction with Erythrite. During deep meditation exercises, these crystals work together to provide one with the ultimate chakra cleansing tool. Much like reiki healing, Aragonite and Erythrite assist one in cleansing their entire aura and providing nurturing vibrations. As stated above, place these minerals directly over the area of pain.

Initially, this tiny Quartz deposit is a gap-filled vein that has crystals connecting to both metamorphic rocks. Over an extremely long period of time, the two rocks will begin to separate. This gives the Quartz an opportunity to continue crystallizing. This slow stretching of the Quartz crystals results in a “string” like effect (that can be seen in high-quality pieces). A secondary layer of Quartz then grows on top of this initial “Quartz string” and crystallizes over it.","Thread Formation":"Faden Quartz is typically found wherever high tectonic activity has occurred. The mountains of Pakistan produce some of the most beautiful Faden Quartz the mineral market has ever seen. The “thread” in this material is unlike any other Faden’s that we have come across, with the Brazilian version (specifically found in Minas Geras) coming in a close second. The brittleness of this stone makes some pieces break upon touch, which is part of the reason why Faden Quartz is so valuable. Lastly, there may be liquid inclusions within some pieces which are also known as an Enhdryo.","Meaning & Energy":"Like nearly every other variety of Quartz, Faden Quartz helps one achieve unparalleled clarity, enhanced inner visions, and opening of the spiritual body. The uniqueness of this crystal is the amplification of the root chakra and the divine connection to Mother Earth. Faden Quartz are some of the oldest Quartz that we have uncovered as a collective society. This crystal contains ancient Earth energies encapsulated within its core Quartz structure. With a secondary layer of crystal growing atop this “Quartz string”, it allows new potent life force energy to be channeled from within this crystal structure."},"props":{"Inner

& Origin of Fairy Stone":"Fairy Stones, sometimes known as Goddess Stones or Menilite Opal, are unusual minerals composed of calcium carbonate and clay. The “disc”, which is common slang to describe their structure, can sometimes be formed over small pebbles and even fossils. You’ll most likely find them in a grey or off-white color, but they can also be seen as tan, beige, and brown. Many tribes and societies have used Fairy Stones in their culture, giving it many different names. It wasn’t until the Algonquin Tribe of Northern Quebec officially coined them “Fairy Stones”. These magical minerals are mostly found in ancient glacier deposits within Canada, but can also be found in Scandinavia, Greenland, the British Isles, and Morocco.","Meaning & Energy":"Fairy stones have been used as good luck and protection talismans for centuries amongst numerous diverse groups of people. It was common for many tribesmen in northern Canada to carry a Fairy Stone on them to promote wealth and prosperity throughout their families. Another common practice was gifting a piece to a loved one to help symbolize their bond, as well as handing off a bit of “luck”. When it came to protection, it was believed that Fairy Stones helped grant one safety from evil gods and deities. During rituals, it would have been very common to see multiple Fairy Stones in the hopes of providing an etheric shield around the practicing group. Some families within these tribes swore by this stone and even slid it under their young child’s bed in the hopes of preventing frightening nightmares.","Amulet of Mother Earth":"Each Fairy Stone should be viewed as an amulet, which has been imbued by our planet’s magical energy. Just carrying a piece on you will enhance your entire aura and provide a layer of protection from any negative energy you may come across. To further access Fairy Stone’s power, begin to have daily meditation sessions where you place all your focus into the stone. Visualize your mind connecting with the vibrations of the stone and allow it to take your consciousness on a journey towards spiritual awakening and enlightenment. Let these Fairy Stones aid you on your life path, as well as all your future decision making."},"props":{"Nourishing and

known as Chert, is a sedimentary mineral and cryptocrystalline form of Quartz. It crystallizes in the form of masses and nodules, while usually occurring in limestone and chalk. Its color is predominantly grey, but can also be found as black, brown, red, pink, blue, green, white, and light yellow. Flint is a very common mineral that can be found all over the world. It can even be found on beaches, rivers, and lakes. Large, commercialized deposits can be seen in countries such as the United States, Belgium, Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland, Switzerland, and Romania.","Ancient Uses":"Flint has a long history and traces of this mineral are directly intertwined with human evolution. Carving and building tools made out of Flint have been found and dated back millions of years ago. It is believed that people once heated Flint for a short period of time in order to make it more durable. This can be seen when examining ancient arrowheads and other weapons made out of Flint during the Stone Age. Aside from the creation of weapons and tools, Flint was heavily used as a building material during the Middle Ages. This mineral was especially utilized in the United Kingdom to build churches, houses, small tiered castles, and protective barriers.","Meaning & Energy":"Flint is an exceptional grounding stone that extracts Earth’s purest vibrations. It assists in advancing one’s ability to channel this energy throughout their emotional and physical bodies. This energy is raw and extremely potent, thus aiding one on their quest of self discovery. By simply meditating with Flint and using it as a talisman of ancient power, one can consciously see layers of who they once were. This experience brings your past-life to the surface and enables you to draw knowledge from these events. These experiences can happen during deep meditation sessions, but also during dream cycles if Flint is near you. There is much to learn from this stone, and though it’s appearance isn’t flattering, it truly is a “sleeper crystal”. Working with it constantly will allow your aura to become attached to this stone.","Carrying Flint":"When you go to grab your normal set of crystals that you carry daily, add Flint to that collection and ask yourself, “Do I notice anything different about myself?”. It may be the slightest change, but one constant effect practitioners rave about is it’s overall ability to center one’s balance. Flint has a unique ability to help your physical and emotional bodies come together in unison, while one’s mind can remain clear while handling different tasks. This is profound for anyone dealing with a difficult situation in their life."},"props":{"Prosperity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/prosperity","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Life

Fulgurites are commonly found in 1” to 3” pieces, but can be found as big as 5’-10’. Most of the time the larger pieces are extremely fragile and near impossible to unearth in one piece.

A local miner accidentally found this mineral in 1995 and chose to name it “Galaxite” after our galaxy; due to the resemblances when one looks up into our night sky. However, that name has already been coined for another mineral, an aluminum magnesium iron-rich member of the Spinel family whose name is derived after the Galex plant. Due to this, a “y” was added to “Galaxyite” to honor the given name while also avoiding confusion in the mineral community.","Meaning & Energy":"Galaxyite shares nearly identical energies to Labradorite, with the only difference being the condensed power it offers. All of the tiny crystallized specs of Labradorite create an energy capable of enhancing and unlocking any chakra this stone is placed over. Like Labradorite, your entire chakra column will become activated and begin to rebalance your ethereal system. However, Galaxyite takes it one step further and pushes whatever chakra you designate to the forefront, allowing you to understand who you really are."},"props":{"Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Bridging the Spiritual and Physical Worlds":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/bridging-the-spiritual-and-physical-worlds","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Expansion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expansion","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Attunement With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement-with-higher-realms","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Selflessness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/selflessness","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Synchronicity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/synchronicity","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Attunement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/7618/conversions/Galayite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/7618/Galayite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Galena.wav","Planets":["Earth"],"Chakras":["Root"],"Zodiacs":["Capricorn"],"Elements":["Earth"],"Colors":["Grey","Silver"],"id":"galena","relURL":"/crystals/galena","name":"Galena","Formula":"PbS","Hardness":{"min":3,"max":3},"Related":[{"Uvarovite Garnet":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/uvarovite-garnet"},{"Green Tiger Eye":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/green-tiger-eye"},{"Tiger Iron":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/tiger-iron"},{"Sonora Sunrise":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/sonora-sunrise"},{"Ruby in Kyanite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/ruby-in-kyanite"},{"Ruby Fuchsite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/ruby-fuchsite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Galena":"Galena is a lead sulfide mineral that crystallizes in the form of masses, cubes, octahedrons, and fibrous layers. Today, it's the most important lead ore when it comes to the production of goods. This mineral was first described back in 77 A.D. by Gaius Plinius Secundus (Pliny the Elder). He named it after the Latin word meaning “lead ore” due to it having been used as a source of lead for multiple different societies. This was due in part to the relatively low melting point needed to smelt Galena. The source of this mineral in ancient times was the island of Sardinia, Italy, although today notable localities stretch across the globe. Some countries such as Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States are producing the finest Galena specimens to date.","Historic Uses":"Galena has been used throughout ancient times for a variety of different reasons, but it's mainly used for smelting. As stated above, this mineral melts at very low temperatures, making it an easy material to work with. The Ancient Egyptians used to grind Galena up into a powder to rub around their eyes. This was done to reduce the glare from the hot desert sun and to keep pesticides away from their exfoliated faces. In addition the Ancient Romans would smelt down Galena and use it to make both their water pipes and public baths. Not to mention, the Ancient Babylonian and Assyrian people would use it as construction material and build with it. It also found a role in the form of currency as Chinese empires would use Galena to make coins. As described, this mineral is very versatile!","Meaning & Energy":"Galena is one of the strongest grounding stones we know of, and we recommend it to anyone who's constantly working towards their goals. Our root chakra becomes open and activated when working with Galena, allowing us to fully ground ourselves down to the earth. Physically, this stone is very dense and heavy, which mimics the vibrations Galena radiates. The energy one feels when working with this stone is very powerful and helps to recharge your internal “battery”. It provides the much needed energy to get long and challenging tasks done. We suggest placing this stone in any workplace, office, meditation or exercise room. Galena will fill the environment with positive energy that can push one into action."},"props":{"Love & Relationships":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/love-relationships","Creativity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creativity","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Courage":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/courage","Grounding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grounding","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Personal Will":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/personal-will","Compassion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/compassion","Motivation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/motivation","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/411/conversions/232300037-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/411/232300037.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Garnet.wav","Planets":["Mars"],"Chakras":["Root"],"Zodiacs":["Aries","Leo","Virgo","Capricorn","Aquarius"],"Elements":["Fire","Earth"],"Colors":["Red","Blood Red "],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"garnet","relURL":"/crystals/garnet","name":"Garnet","Formula":"(Mg, Ca, Fe2+, Mn2+)3(Al, Fe3+, Cr3+, V3+)2(SiO4)3","Hardness":{"min":7,"max":8},"Related":[{"Carnelian":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/carnelian"},{"Sardonyx":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/sardonyx"},{"Bloodstone":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/bloodstone"},{"Uvarovite Garnet":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/uvarovite-garnet"},{"Ruby":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/ruby"},{"Dravite (Brown Tourmaline)":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/dravite-brown-tourmaline"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Garnet":"Garnet is a silicate group of minerals that was first recorded as ΑνθραϪέ in 325 B.C. by Theophrastus. Pliny the Elder additionally recorded this stone in 77 A.D. as Carchedonius Garamanticus or Garamantic Carbuncle. The word Garnet derives from Gernet meaning “dark red” and the word “Granatus'' meaning grain or seed, in reference to its resemblance to a Pomegranate. Traditionally the Garnet group of minerals is composed of 6 sub-minerals: Almandine, Pyrope, Spessartine, Andradite, Grossular, and Uvaroite. Deposits of Garnet can be found all over the world with large specimens coming out of our old home state of Connecticut in the United States.","Historical Uses":"Garnets have historically been regarded as a stone that helps with hemorrhages, inflammatory diseases, and the suppression of anger. Doctors lived by the code “similia similibus curantu” meaning “like is cured by like”. Thus, for ailments that pertained to blood, Garnet was likely prescribed. Asian tribes took it a step further by using small Garnets as bullets, believing that they would cause more harm than a regular one.","Meaning & Energy":"Garnet awakens our inner-fire and helps produce some of the strongest life force energy in the entire mineral kingdom. Pure strength and fortitude is activated within and the confidence in one’s self will raise to an all-time high. Once we are comfortable with ourselves, we are then capable of transmuting the most negative vibrations into positive ones. Your everyday focus should start pertaining more to yourself and your personal growth. Understanding who you truly are in this world is a lifelong struggle, but Garnet will nudge you into the right mindset.","Manifestation Tool":"Garnet is an orb of manifestation energy that can be channeled by an experienced practitioner during their sessions. The red rays of life force energy help bring our desires to life and expand upon our internal dreams. We suggest holding and speaking directly into your crystal, expressing what it is your heart wants. As you release these vocal commands you are reminding yourself of your goals and further planting the seed in your head. This seed will begin to blossom and grow as you begin to undertake the mission. By listening to your heart and attempting to achieve what you desire, you will feel an immense form of gratitude and happiness regardless of the final outcome or how long it may take.

This chemical element gives Garnierite that distinguishable green color. However, heavy levels of Nickel are capable of creating an olive to dark green hue as well. Officially, this crystal has no definitive chemical composition that can be agreed upon within the mineral community. Some geologists believe it to be a Quartz crystalline base with a chemical body closely resembling Lizardite (a variety of Serpentine), Chrysoprase (a variety of Chalcedony with minor Nickel inclusions), or Peridot.","Meaning & Energy":"Garnierite was discovered in 1867 by Jacque Jules Garnier, in the French controlled New Caledonia. Seven years later it would officially be named after him while being added to the mineralogy records. Since then, this South Pacific landmass near Australia ( 11,000 miles from mainland France) has become crucial for Nickel extraction, with an estimated 10% of the world’s entire Nickel content being located under the island.","Innocent Energies":"Garnierite is such a unique stone that contains the true essence of life. Such innocent and joyful vibrations begin to emulate upon touch, leaving the user in a blissful trance. The energies of this crystal synchronize with your auric field and begin to fill your etheric body with love, light, and compassion. Your heart chakra becomes fully aligned and relaxed, providing you a chance to look deeply within. What you may find can be traumatic and scary to say the least, but these experiences are a part of us and must be relinquished. Garnierite is extremely potent when used as a spiritual amulet and is capable of providing all the protection one may need during these inward encounters. One must put all their trust into this stone to maximize its benefits. Allow your body to harmonize with this stone and imbue yourself fully with this crystal through deep meditation. Use the energy channeled from this stone to heal the wounds you may carry. Don’t forget to allow space to open up for love and new opportunities."},"props":{"Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Living

& Origin of Gem Silica":"Gem Silica, also known as Chrysocolla Chalcedony or Gem Silica Chrysocolla, is a very rare combination of Quartz and Chrysocolla. This stone is rarely seen on the market and only has a few known localities, which usually run dry within a few years. The most recent Gem Silica that has been seen on the market is coming out of the Miami-Inspiration Mine in Arizona. Other localities that are assumed to have run dry are Mexico, Taiwan, Peru, and the Philippines. This stone is very easily faked and should be met with extreme caution when trying to purchase. Make sure that you trust your dealer and find out the exact location that this stone came from. Most fakes on the market are actually just milky Chalcedony that are dyed.","Meaning & Energy":"This stone carries and enhances all qualities and properties of Chrysocolla, while also connecting one's throat chakra to their third eye and heart. This unique channel offers one the ability to better understand their feelings and how to effectively process their emotions. Gem Silica pushes one to release any lingering trauma or sadness that they may hold onto. One’s intuition is raised when using Gem Silica and will continue to focus your attention on the minor details about yourself. This elevated focus helps one accept the weight they’ve been carrying and finally work towards removing it. This may consist of finally vocalizing a sensitive subject with a close friend, or accepting a situation for what it's worth and moving past it. Either way, the strength of this mineral will help pull all the negativity out and allow you to finally start looking ahead with a clear and joyful heart. One’s aura will soon radiate positivity, affecting any and all who may have the privilege of coming in contact with you.","Mind, Heart and Soul":"This combination mineral helps one connect to higher realms and better understand the knowledge within. By achieving a strong connection between your third eye and throat chakra, one can vocalize and easily describe what they see in deep meditation or dreams. The imagery within these experiences have great symbolism that directly relates to one’s life and the opportunities currently around them. Gem Silica helps push one to take action and pursue the life path you desire, while helping connect you to your higher self along the way."},"props":{"Leadership":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/leadership","Passion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/passion","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","New

Goethite is considered a fairly common mineral with an abundance in countries such as the UK, Australia, the USA, and Brazil.","Meaning & Energy":"Goethite is a stone described as “one with the earth”, simply because of the connection one will develop with Mother Earth. Working with this stone repeatedly will help one fully root themselves down to this plane and look at life through a completely different set of lenses. Our root, sacral, and third eye all become activated when using this stone, with a clear channel between these chakras being formed. One will be able to take the visions that they see through their third eye and pull them down to a much more physical level.

Chalcedony":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/blue-chalcedony"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Goshenite":"Goshenite is an aluminum beryllium silicate mineral and is commonly referred to as the colorless variety of Beryl. It crystallizes in the form of small prismatic shards, vertically striated “icicles”, and hexagonal rods. Goshenite has been used throughout multiple different societies but wasn’t officially discovered until 1844 by C.U. Shepard. He chose to name it after the locality of its discovery, Goshen, Massachusetts. Since then, the main deposits of colorless beryl have shifted overseas to Pakistan and Russia, in addition to small important deposits from the country of Brazil.","Meaning & Energy":"Goshenite is an extremely high vibrational stone that resonates directly with your third eye and crown chakras. Intuition, mental stimulation, clarity, and a heightened sense of awareness occur when one starts working with this stone. Your manifestation levels will reach an all-time high as you are using pure, transparent Beryl energy to imbue your intentions with the universe. Your general concentration and mental drive will be a night and day difference, as well as the duration and strength of your meditative sessions. One may notice themselves truly “falling” into their experiences each time, with a stronger connection being built to the celestial world with each use!","Strength Over Time":"Goshenite thankfully doesn’t absorb much energy when it’s being worked with. This allows one to manifest, meditate, and carry this stone over and over again. As Goshenite becomes your own personal amulet, one’s aura will passively become stronger and more resilient to negative, earthbound energy. One will also notice the development of increased patience within, helping navigate through uncertain times. Instead of making an uneducated decision that can truly affect your life path, Goshenite settles any internal struggles and suggests looking beyond this reality (internally) to lifes biggest questions."},"props":{"Living in the Present Moment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/living-in-the-present-moment","Peace of

& Origin of Grandidierite":"Grandidierite is an iron magnesium silicate mineral that appears in orthorhombic formations. Blue varieties of this crystal appear when there is more Iron found within the deposit. Grandidierite was first discovered on the cliffs of Andrahomana in 1902 by Alfred Lacroix. Alfred named this crystal in honor of the French explorer Alfred Grandidier who famously explored Madagascar. This mineral is extremely rare and most raw material is instantly sent away to be cut into high tiered jewelry. In 2003 a new deposit of transparent Grandidierite was found in the Kolonne area of Sri Lanka. To date, this mineral is only found in Madagascar and Sri Lanka.","Meaning & Energy":"It's not every day that you get the chance to work with such a powerful and rare stone. We were fortunate enough to come in contact with raw pieces of Grandidierite and had immense experiences with it. Its manifestation energies pull you into the direction of what your heart truly desires. We often find ourselves at the edge of a cliff, wanting to jump, but we are too stricken with fear of the unknown to push ourselves off. Grandidierite opens your mind's eye and shows the benefits of making that final leap. The throat, third eye, and heart chakra become linked together when working with Grandidierite. This trifecta gives your heart and mind the opportunity to freely communicate with each other. This clear channel of thought can help you make concrete decisions that are best for your future. Creating your own reality requires confidence and determination. Don’t be afraid to take that first step!","Enhance Your Inner-Visions":"Grandidierite will open up your mind so that you can clearly see your truest potential. When sleeping next to this stone, you may find your dreams extremely moving and communicative, similar to that of Cavansite. Tasks or goals that you have been daunting over will wash away and appear much easier than expected. Authors Note: We would consider this stone the fast track tool of manifestation. The dreams we personally experienced were vivid future events that had yet to take place. After having dreamt of these encounters, the task at hand seemed much easier and achievable (almost as if it had already happened!)."},"props":{"Expansion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expansion","High Vibration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/high-vibrations","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Astral Travel":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/astral-travel","Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication","Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Prosperity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/prosperity","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Mental Enhancement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mental-enhancement","Mastering Fear":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mastering-fear","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Dreams":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dreams","Determination":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/determination","Decisiveness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/decisiveness","Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality","Confidence":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/confidence","Claiming Wholeness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/claiming-wholeness","Ascension":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ascension","Alignment with the Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/alignment-with-the-higher-self","Abundance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/abundance"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/5955/conversions/Grandidierite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/5955/Grandidierite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Grape%20Agate.wav","Planets":["Jupiter"],"Colors":["Indigo","Violet","Purple"],"Parent Property":[],"Chakras":["Third Eye","Crown","Etheric"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Zodiacs":["Cancer","Sagittarius"],"Elements":["Storm"],"id":"grape-agate","relURL":"/crystals/grape-agate","name":"Grape Agate","Formula":"SiO2","Hardness":{"min":6.5,"max":7},"Related":[{"Covellite ":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/covellite"},{"Afghanite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/afghanite"},{"Cryolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/cryolite"},{"Colorless Topaz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/colorless-topaz"},{"Cavansite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/cavansite"},{"Blue Aventurine":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/blue-aventurine"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Grape Agate":"Grape Agate is the name given to the botryoidal Purple Chalcedony that has been recently discovered in Indonesia.

Very rarely green colored specimens are found amongst a purple vein, and even bi-colored green and purple pieces have been found! These are amongst the rarest, as they’re truly the definition of “Grape Agate”. When wanting to purchase one of these stones, it's important to know that your buying from an authentic dealer. Pieces that are dirty or sometimes barely purple have been dyed and are actually quite common to see on the market. ","Meaning & Energy":"Grape Agate is a powerful intuitive stone that activates and links the crown and third eye chakras together.

If you are someone who constantly dreams, we recommend placing this stone at your bedside each night to allow the powerful energies of this stone to work while you sleep. Ones dreams will become more controllable and the images within them will become more clear. Your mind will become stronger than ever and push you to understand the images you see and how they can affect your current life.

Many users hold a piece firmly in their hand while they manifest their dreams and desires. Others swear by bringing some to the casino, racetracks, or game nights. To increase your luck, we recommend carrying a piece of Lapis Lazuli or Jet alongside Green Aventurine.

This stone almost always comes in the form of large masses.","Meaning & Energy":"This crystal is a very powerful heart stone that is here to help calm and rejuvenate our most vital organ. It's the perfect stone to help relieve unneeded daily stress and calm our pent up energies that may have been brewing all day. Simply holding a piece while taking in deep breaths can make us soon forget the reason for all our distress. Working with this stone helps strengthen the connection to our heart and provides insight as to where we need to focus our emotions. So often do we lead with our head and not our heart, that we fail to recognize our head is full of distractions and rapidly changing emotions. It is the heart that holds the most vital information we carry, which is why it should be used first in any decision making process.","Healer of the Heart":"We recommend meditating with Green Calcite as often as possible. It's important to focus on your heart during these sessions so you can bring to the surface all the trauma weighing it down. We must face it, accept it, and move forward from it. Green Calcite will become your best friend when dealing with such issues and will help you push past them. It’s important for us to not be defined but rather motivated by these issues. If we continuously go back to our problems and use them as an excuse, we will never overcome our challenges. When the time to move forward has risen, it's vital to embrace it and accept these new beginnings!","Strengthen Your Connection With Nature":"Green Calcite has a very unique connection with nature, so we urge you to meditate outside with the stone! Dusk and dawn are the preferred times to use it because they are the most energetic times of the day. Clear your mind and close your eyes while either holding a piece of Green Calcite or placing it in front of you. As you begin taking deep breaths, envision your aura being filled with green rays of rejuvenating energies. Take this time to focus on both yourself and your heart space. We urge you to do this as often as you need in addition to carrying a piece of Green Calcite with you as much as possible."},"props":{"Soothing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/soothing","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Dreams":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dreams","Love & Relationships":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/love-relationships","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Sleep":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sleep","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Physical Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/physical-healing","Balancing Polarities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balancing-polarities","Unity of Heart and Will":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/unity-of-heart-and-will","Connection with Nature":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/connection-with-nature","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/428/conversions/DSC01877-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/335/conversions/IMG_0390-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/428/DSC01877.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Green%20Garnet.wav","Parent Property":[],"Colors":["Venusian-Green","Olive Green ","Green"],"Elements":["Fire","Earth"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Zodiacs":["Aquarius","Capricorn","Virgo","Leo","Aries"],"Planets":["Mars"],"Chakras":["Heart","Root"],"id":"green-garnet","relURL":"/crystals/green-garnet","name":"Green Garnet","Formula":"Ca3Al2(SiO4)3","Hardness":{"min":7,"max":7},"Related":[{"Green Tiger Eye":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/green-tiger-eye"},{"Chrysanthemum Stone":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/chrysanthemum-stone"},{"Pink Chalcedony":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pink-chalcedony"},{"Sonora Sunrise":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/sonora-sunrise"},{"Eclogite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/eclogite"},{"Staurolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/staurolite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Green Garnet":"Green Garnet is an uncommon variety of Garnet that’s composed of aluminum and calcium, with possible traces of chromium and vanadium.

Within the 6 types of Garnets (Andradite, Grossular, Uvarovite, Pyrope, Almandite, Spessartite) only Grossular, Andradite, and Uvarovite can be seen as green. For most types, the color can range from a transparent light green to a dark green that can look almost black. The rarest variety of Green Garnet is the Demantoid Garnet, where finding a stone weighing more than 2 carats is extremely rare.","Meaning & Energy":"A few chemical impurities within it are the only differences between Green and Red Garnet’s physical structure. These colors share the same properties and project very similar energies. One minor difference is the connection that Green Garnet has with your heart space. This stone helps one open themselves up to the world around them and better connect them to the ones they love. Happiness and joy may soon follow, with one turning their attention to their truest desires. Achieving those emotions will become a priority, as you will soon realize the importance of self-accomplishments. Garnet's natural manifesting and grounding ability make this a true power stone.

one of the newest additions to our personal mineral kingdom! This variety of kyanite has been one of the hardest to find a steady supply of. After manifesting and searching far and wide, we finally learned of a newly discovered vein that was recently found in India. One of our most trusted suppliers was also on the hunt for this crystal and immediately began importing a small amount of Green Kyanite that the mine would release for global consumption. Thankfully for us, we were able to get a small amount shipped right before the Covid-19 global pandemic broke out. Since then, the entire world’s stock of crystals has diminished significantly, especially the rare and harder to come by stones such as Green Kyanite. We highly value the small amount of stock that we have and truly believe the heavy Earth essence it carries can rapidly heal and rejuvenate one's entire being (especially your emotional body).","Meaning & Energy":"Green Kyanite activates your entire chakra column, however it resonates deeply with one’s heart. As restorative energy is channeling from Mother Earth and imbuing your aura, one becomes more aware of their emotional needs. This can also help you develop the strength to let negativity move away from you. Our minds have a “heart of their own” and can control our entire emotional body with little to no power! This is partly due to the trust within our brain, as opposed to pledging all our confidence into a vulnerable, deep-feeling organ such as our heart. One’s mind is much easier to be manipulated and can bring about a false reality if left unchecked. Green Kyanite will push the strength that's in your mind down to your entire body which will lead to eventual balance within yourself. This effect provides a much needed resurgence of courage and love within the body, which happens to be a recipe for ultimate success and happiness. Thais is because you are not only becoming more aware of yourself, but also how you feel day in and day out. Once you understand the potential of Green Kyanite and the powers that be, only then will the beauty within you shine endlessly for all to see."},"props":{"Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Power":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/power","Physical

It crystallized in mass formations and its hue of color comes from the amount of Fuchsite impurities within. What is so fascinating about this stone is its unique hardness even though it contains the soft mica mineral. It was discovered by Jonathan Bartky on the Massai Tribal land in northern Tanzania. Bartky is involved in the sourcing and mining of this mineral and has his own company known as Ariel Treasures.","Meaning & Energy":"Green Tanzurine engages our self-loving processes to allow us to be comfortable in our own bodies. This comfortability allows us to express ourselves by bringing out our unique character. Through our own gentle self-expression, our heart and soul will begin to flutter in happiness. This will cause a chain reaction that will spread to others and instill a positive atmosphere for growth. Showing who you are not only affects yourself and others but also the energy of our home planet.","Emotional Regeneration":"Green Tanzurine has a natural connection to Earth and the abundant energy that she releases each day. One profound effect is the regeneration of our emotional body during times of meditation, especially outside. During certain hours of the day, with dusk and dawn being the most important, the earth’s energies are in their highest vibratory state. You will feel nature and all of its beings “come alive” or rest and you can tap into this spiritual displacement. Channeling our home planet’s energies only invigorates our place in this world and drastically alters the course of our lives. We recommend placing a few pieces of Green Tanzurine around you, making yourself the center of a Nature Grid. During this process, we can channel earthen energy and allow it to ground us to the present moment. Use this to bolden your life mission and push you onto the path towards emotional and spiritual success."},"props":{"Self-Love":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-love","Calming and

& Origin of Green Tiger Eye":"Green Tiger Eye is an extremely rare variety of Tiger Eye and member of the Quartz family. It has only been found crystallized in the form of masses, which led to it being a popular stone for cutting cabochons and other forms of jewelry. We’ve only seen a few pieces extracted from either Brazil or Madagascar on the mineral market. Sadly, this mineral is often faked so be extremely wary when purchasing any form of Green Tiger Eye. We suggest looking for irregularities on the surface of the stone, such as spotted asymmetrical Quartz inclusions, an iron banding pattern (usually dark black) or an unnatural color palette.","Meaning & Energy":"Both Green Tiger Eye and Tiger Eye have nearly identical energies and chemical bodies (with small mineral inclusions that contribute to the change in color). One slight difference we’ve picked up from working with Green Tiger Eye has been the slight (and silent) opening of the heart chakra. As we all know, Tiger Eye not only contributes to your character development, but also accesses and enhances your personal will. Green Tiger Eye does just that, but also connects your will and heart together. This forges a bond capable of relinquishing inner doubt and fear, while allowing your heart and not your head to lead. This can propel your own understanding of what you personally want, rather than the ones that society has forced upon you."},"props":{"Mastering

known as Verdelite, is a lithium rich crystalline boron silicate mineral and member of the Tourmaline family. It crystallizes in the form of elongated rods or triangular and pyramidal crystals; almost always on or associated with Quartz. This Tourmaline variety was discovered in Uno, Sweden by Johan August Arfwedson in 1818. He was also the first person to discover lithium within any Tourmaline variety, a highly touted scientific success at the time. This mineral is one of the more common colors of Tourmaline you’ll find, with important deposits located in Brazil, Pakistan, Namibia, Afghanistan, and the United States.","Meaning & Energy":"Green Tourmaline is a stone that warms the heart and helps one rejuvenate vital life force energy. It’s vibrations help one tap into their emotional body to understand the emotions they feel. So often is our brain full of different stressors that it can lead one to blame how they feel on unrelated variables. Green Tourmaline helps one look past these minor annoyances to get to the root of your emotional pain. One will be able to identify the trauma they’ve been carrying and understand what it is exactly that's holding them back from moving forward. By working with this stone continuously and tapping into the self-healing energies it provides, one will become more calm and able to look towards finding solutions to heal all emotional pain.","Expanding Your Awareness":"Green Tourmaline provides one with a heightened sense of awareness and is here to help you grow into an image of your higher self. Its vibrations push one's mind to follow their heart and desires. One’s focus becomes laser sharp and actively pushes you to move towards the direction you need to go in. There may be many distractions in your life each day, but Green Tourmaline will provide you with the tunnel vision needed to continue pushing forward.","Pairing With Pyrite":"Try using this stone with Pyrite for expanding one's power, drive, and manifestation abilities. These two minerals combined will provide one with the confidence and willpower to push through any obstacles, leading to the strength you need to reach your dreams. Try meditating with both these minerals in front of you and set two of your most desired intentions into them. Connect yourself with the vibrations of these stones and allow their energies to instill trust and positivity throughout your mind. They should serve as a reminder each day that you are on the correct path, pursuing what's most important to you."},"props":{"Physical Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/physical-healing","Grounding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grounding","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Nourishing and Rejuvenation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nourishing-and-rejuvenation","New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Nuturing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nuturing","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Soothing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/soothing","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Trauma":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trauma","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Unity of Heart and Will":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/unity-of-heart-and-will","Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Breaking Addictions":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/breaking-addictions","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Claiming Wholeness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/claiming-wholeness","Clairvoyance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clairvoyance","Compassion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/compassion","Connection with Nature":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/connection-with-nature","Consciousness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/consciousness","Decisiveness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/decisiveness","Determination":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/determination","Elimination Toxins":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/elimination-toxins","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Empathy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/empathy","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Expansion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expansion","Focus":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/focus","Generosity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/generosity"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/365/conversions/Green-Tourmaline-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/365/Green-Tourmaline.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Grenatite.wav","Parent Property":[],"Elements":["Earth","Fire"],"Chakras":["Sacral","Root"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Colors":["Blood Red ","Red"],"Planets":["Earth","Mars"],"Zodiacs":["Aquarius","Capricorn","Virgo","Leo","Aries"],"id":"grenatite","relURL":"/crystals/grenatite","name":"Grenatite","Formula":"Fe2+2Al9Si4O23(OH)","Hardness":{"min":0,"max":0},"Related":[{"Orthoclase":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/orthoclase"},{"Stromatolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/stromatolite"},{"Rhyolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/rhyolite"},{"Mookaite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/mookaite"},{"Brochantite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/brochantite"},{"Peanut Obsidian":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/peanut-obsidian"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Grenatite":"Grenatite is a recently discovered mineral from the country of Madagascar.

& Origin of Gyrolite":"Gyrolite, also known as Centrallasite, Glimmer Zeolite, and Gurolite, is a rare sodium calcium silicate hydrate mineral. This crystal is a member of the Zeolite family and crystallizes in the form of radiating spherical structures, usually within basalt. Gyrolite is found in a bright white color, but can also be seen as brown, grey, and sometimes green (very rare). This mineral was first discovered in Scotland, at The Storr on the island of Sykes in 1851. T. Anderson chose to name Gyrolite after the Greek word “Guros”, meaning circular or round. Since his discovery, only a few other localities have been able to produce the same quality of Gyrolite as that of Scotland. These localities include Poona, India, Northern Ireland, Italy, Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Canada, and the western USA. This rare crystal can also be found in association with almost all other Zeolite minerals, especially Okenite. Prehnite  and Apophyllite are also common minerals that form with or near Gyrolite.","Meaning & Energy":"Gyrolite helps one link their solar plexus, third eye, and crown chakras together. A unique channel forms between these 3 important chakras, allowing one to manifest their deepest desires while using higher knowledge and energy to push you towards it. Using one’s third eye, you will be able to better understand the path forward and the actions needed to get you exactly where you want to be. Gyrolite helps us link up to our spirit guides, assisting and guiding us along our life path. Deep meditation sessions will help one connect to these angels and better understand the messages and ideas they wish to channel. This mineral is somewhat of an “awakening” stone, helping one clear their mind of any “fog” so that they may begin writing a new chapter in their life book. Some practitioners have stated the desire to pursue new ideas and avenues, as well as taking up activities completely foreign, and sometimes even unknown.","Crystal Pairings":"Use this stone in combination with other high vibrational stones to help one immerse themselves in the spirit realm. Try meditating with Apophyllite, Stilbite, Phenacite, Quartz, or Rutile to enhance the strength of Gyrolite. All these stones, along with Gyrolite, will help one fully understand messages from the higher ups, as well as establish a permanent connection with these beings. "},"props":{"Power":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/power","Interdimensional

capabilities. One will be able to see the strength that the human mind possesses, which can lead them to the gateway of higher knowledge. This elevated knowledge is from celestial beings in addition to one’s own spirit guides and guardian angels. The messages you receive may be bleak and confusing, but working with Hackmanite will help you learn the “language of the gods”. This special mineral helps one not only decode the imagery within their own visions, but also the symbolism in one's nightly dreams. These are signs pointing you in the direction that your soul desires. By nature, humans are caught up in daily distractions, which only push one further away from achieving their dreams. However, Hackmanite works to help one prioritize what's most important to them and how they should go about achieving it.","Spiritual Evolution":"We highly recommend this stone as a means for one's personal growth and spiritual evolution. One will begin to know the true power of Hackmanite and it’s energies as they continue to work with the stone. Just as this stone reveals hidden colors when exposed to special light, it will also do the same to you. Hackmanite is YOUR special light that helps peel back your layers and reveals the beauty of your mind and soul.","Express Your Feelings The Right Way":"This mineral also enhances all communication abilities and helps one easily discuss what's on their mind. Hackmanite naturally provides a special connection between your mind and throat. This connection pushes one to become expressive and vocal with their personal ideas, feelings, and desires. So embrace your thoughts and don't be afraid to share them. Let the world hear the real you as you begin to inspire the ones around you!"},"props":{"Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Inner

& Origin of Hanksite":"Hanksite is a potassium sulfate mineral that crystallizes in the form of prismatic shards and elongated, tabular crystals. Many chemical and clay impurities can affect its color while forming, leading this mineral to be found in a variety of colors such as white, yellow, grey, light green, light blu,e and even colorless (possibly transparent). Hanksite was first discovered in Searles Lake in San Bernardino, California around 1884-1885 by William Earl Hidden. He chose to name it after Henry Garber Hanks, the first state mineralogist of California (who was still in public office at the time).","Meaning & Energy":"Hanksite is a very earth-heavy stone that assists in grounding your physical body, while aiding in the realignment of your etheric chakra system. The energies of this Potassium Sulfate mineral merge with that of your own aura. This helps to cleanse and clear your entire spiritual body of any harmful vibrations that may be “stuck” on you. These negative energies are extremely harmful for your personal growth and can cause one to carry a lack of confidence as well as fill your mind with pure toxicity. For one to be able to prosper, love, and pursue their most desired dreams, a natural flow of positive energy must be channeled inward, so that you may redirect it outwards. It is through this important process that one is able to strip away their own personal hardships and directly heal their mind, body, and soul. For best results, meditate with your piece of Hanksite over the most affected areas of your body. The potency of this crystal is capable of extinguishing any unwanted thought, vibration, or energy one carries with them daily. Continue seeking the healing frequencies of Hanksite as much as possible and learn to become comfortable and trustworthy of this intense purification stone."},"props":{"Calming and

Since this stone is so hard to acquire, crystal collectors and spiritual practitioners have yearned to get their hands on Healer’s Gold. Ever since then, the value completely skyrocketed, with the supply being a fraction of that.","Meaning & Energy":"Healer’s Gold is a new age amulet here to provide much-needed motivation in a world full of complete distractions. If one is not able to connect with earth-born energies or simply create and achieve internal desires; this is the stone for you. The energy you have within yourself is completely unique and offers one limitless potential. Healer’s Gold naturally advances one’s thought process to appreciate and finally accept the inner strength that you hold. As one’s mental capacity begins to see the path in which your soul is heading, only then will you truly find yourself. Trust your natural instincts, remind yourself of where you've been, and know WHY exactly you're on the journey you're on. Healer’s Gold helps remind one of their own ability to inspire themselves, which in return will naturally influence others to do the same."},"props":{"Luck and Good

Obsidian":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/peanut-obsidian"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Heliodor":"Heliodor, also known as Golden Beryl, is a very rare variety of Beryl that crystallizes in the form of elongated rods (with natural etching) and smaller mass formations (but large enough for carving and sculpting). The bright golden color Heliodor is known for comes from inclusions of Iron within. These same inclusions, depending on amount and density, can also give Heliodor a yellow-greenish tint (These are deemed “lower quality” in some collectors eyes, but we believe the energies are exactly the same and just as powerful). Heliodor was first discovered in 1912 by E. Kaiser in the African country of Namibia. This pure yellow beryl deposit was designated Heliodor (after the Greek words “Helios”, meaning “sun” and “Doron”, meaning “gift”), with it being the only vein in existence. Since that time the name has been gradually absorbed and refers to all of the world’s yellow beryls (although that is still a hotly debated subject amongst geologists). Important Heliodor localities are thin and spread throughout the entire world, with major deposits in Ukraine, Sri Lanka, Namibia, Brazil, Finland, Russia, and Madagascar.","A Rare Beryl":"One of the main reasons why Heliodor isn’t as well known as other Beryl varieties is solely due to it’s supply line. It’s one of the rarest beryllium silicates on planet Earth, with much of the lower quality material being heated at high temperatures to produce an artificial Aquamarine (which has the trade name and can sell quicker and for more). This is a huge international problem and is part of the reason why your local jeweler doesn’t sell any sort of Golden Beryl. Due to this concern in the industry, everyone looking to buy any form of Heliodor should be extremely weary and question the sales person about it’s locality and natural color. One of the indicators we immediately look for is its natural etching!","Meaning & Energy":"Heliodor is one of the strongest stones in helping one achieve a connection and ultimately control over their personal will and solar plexus chakra. In a sense, this beryl is the “key” to unlocking parts of who you are that you never even knew existed. As your “second mind” is housed in your gut, one is able to produce intellectual capabilities from this region. This is called our primal instincts, or in a more spiritual sense, our divine intuition. This “brain” holds a much deeper emotional connection to our soul and truly differs from our mind during pivotal life situations. Heliodor enables one to have more control over these attributes, as well as helping to develop an understanding for how to convey them in this planetary realm. Negative energies surround us daily that often push one towards a path of darkness. The golden light that radiates off Heliodor will help avoid that. Heliodor provides one with a beacon of light that can drown out and end any useless habit or action that divides us from our true self. Through this enlightenment, one will soon find themselves working towards endless happiness which starts from within."},"props":{"Purification":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/purification","PTSD":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ptsd","Prosperity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/prosperity","Power":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/power","Physical

This mineral, originally referred to as “Haematite” wasn’t officially discovered until 1773 by Jean Baptiste rome de I’Isle who removed the first “e” to make it “Hematite.” The name is derived from the Greek word for blood “haima” due to the color the mineral turns when ground to powder.Hematite is a very special mineral that was believed to be used by man 164,000 years ago. A small area south of Mossel Bay in South Africa has been excavated many times since 2000 and produced numerous artifacts dating back hundreds of thousands of years. Interestingly, an observation from one of the excavations was that of writing on a cave wall in a red powder substance. Through extensive research and analysis it was confirmed that this powder was in fact Hematite.","Hematite on Mars":"NASA made a remarkable discovery when they found Hematite on Mars. It was found by the infrared spectrometer on the NASA Mars Global Surveyor and the 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft when it was orbiting the planet. What makes this even more interesting is the need of water for Hematite to occur. NASA Scientists are now studying the images and samples in which they took to help better understand the environment of Mars, and if it is suitable for life.","Meaning & Energy":"Hematite is one of the most powerful grounding stones in the mineral kingdom, intended to root your body and mind back to Earth. This stone helps refocus your thoughts and actions into those that matter to you most while guiding you on the right path. It's a stone of attraction, much like that of a magnet. Hematite is constantly pulling down excess energy from your environment to help you use it towards your best interests. Once your focus becomes anchored to the Earth, Hematite shows you that anything you desire is achievable. Rooting ourselves into the present moment seems to be a harder challenge each day. In the technological world that we are advancing in; it seems difficult for us to stay present within our thoughts. Constantly picking up our phone proves that our mind is looking to escape elsewhere. When connecting with Hematite we are able to strengthen our root chakra to keep our attention on the task at hand. Take a moment each day to work with your Hematite to center your energies into the right frame of mind. If you find yourself matched with a high vibrational stone that you feel is too powerful at the moment (Phenacite, Moldavite, Grandidierite, etc) pair Hematite when working with your crystal to bring in strong grounding energies."},"props":{"Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Balance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balance","Clarity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clarity","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Grounding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grounding","Focus":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/focus","Alignment of Chakra":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/alignment-of-chakra","Balancing Polarities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balancing-polarities","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Action":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/action","Mental Enhancement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mental-enhancement","Transmutation of Negative Energies":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transmutation-of-negative-energies","Organization":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/organization","Channeling and Grounding Higher Vibrations":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/channeling-and-grounding-higher-vibrations"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/64/conversions/3fb1e121c9f5a0a3be8c8c438704cd74-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/64/3fb1e121c9f5a0a3be8c8c438704cd74.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Hemimorphite.wav","Colors":["Green","White","Yellow","Brown","Grey","Blue","Light Blue","Colorless"],"Elements":["Storm"],"Chakras":["Throat","Heart","Third Eye","Etheric"],"Parent Property":[],"Zodiacs":["Libra"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"hemimorphite","relURL":"/crystals/hemimorphite","name":"Hemimorphite","Formula":"Zn4(Si2O7)(OH)2•(H2O)","Hardness":{"min":5,"max":5},"Related":[{"Shattuckite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/shattuckite"},{"Tanzanite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/tanzanite"},{"Plumbogummite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/plumbogummite"},{"Lazulite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/lazulite"},{"Apophyllite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/apophyllite"},{"Muscovite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/muscovite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Hemimorphite":"Hemimorphite is a hydrous zinc silicate that produces fan-shaped tabular crystals and can take on botryoidal forms.

The color of Hemimorphite most commonly seen is a beautiful blue, to light blue color. It also appears as green, white, yellow, brown, grey, and even colorless. This mineral was first recorded back in 1853 by a man named A. Kenngott, and was named after the crystal morphology of symmetry. Hemimorphite is believed to have been around since the 18th century and was actually referred to as “Electric Calamine”. The countries of Algeria, Mexico, Greece, Italy, and Namibia offer the best specimens for metaphysical use. A common belief in ancient times was Hemimorphite’s ability to ward off poisoning, negativity, hatred, and malice. One was urged to carry a piece when going into unsettling environments.","Crystal Pairings":"Hemimorphite can work well in conjunction with higher frequency stones such as Phenacite, Moldavite, and . These stones can better assist in the understanding of higher knowledge and how to directly interject it into your life. All these stones will also help establish a better, stronger connection to these beings. When working on your relationships and learning how to speak difficult things out with your loved ones, we recommend using Rose Quartz alongside Hemimorphite. Rose Quartz will vibrate endless rays full of loving energy to you and your partner. As these rays begin to imbue you, you will notice a sense of calm and relief enter the body. Both these stones together are here to help you stay connected to your loved one while also having immense amounts of compassion for your partner."},"props":{"Channeling":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/channeling","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Astral Travel":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/astral-travel","Ascension":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ascension","Empathy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/empathy","Angelic Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/angelic-communication","Communication With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-higher-realms","Communication with Guides":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-guides","Interdimensional Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/interdimensional-communication","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Abundance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/abundance","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Attunement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement","Alignment with the Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/alignment-with-the-higher-self","Living in the Present Moment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/living-in-the-present-moment","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Bridging the Spiritual and Physical Worlds":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/bridging-the-spiritual-and-physical-worlds","Nourishing and Rejuvenation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nourishing-and-rejuvenation"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/151/conversions/A25019E8-5B66-4E3E-891C-B0D815218D3B-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/152/conversions/E42C8AC0-FD3C-465A-AF97-67FB3893C18B-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/151/A25019E8-5B66-4E3E-891C-B0D815218D3B.jpeg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Herkimer%20Diamond.wav","Chakras":["Crown","Third Eye"],"Zodiacs":["Aries","Sagittarius"],"Elements":["Storm"],"Colors":["Colorless"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Parent Property":[],"id":"herkimer-diamond","relURL":"/crystals/herkimer-diamond","name":"Herkimer Diamond","Formula":"SiO2","Hardness":{"min":7,"max":7},"Related":[{"Dumortierite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/dumortierite"},{"Iolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/iolite"},{"Blue Kyanite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/blue-kyanite"},{"Tanzanite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/tanzanite"},{"Lazulite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/lazulite"},{"Datolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/datolite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Herkimer Quartz Diamond":"Herkimer Quartz is a type of Quartz found in Herkimer, New York.

It crystallizes in the form of masses and grains, as well as forming in the shape of small rhombic crystals (usually on a matrix). Heulandite can occur in a variety of different colors such as orange, yellow, white, brown, red, and green. Green is heavily desired in the metaphysical community due to its relationship with the heart chakra, and gets its color from tiny inclusions of Celadonite. This mineral was first discovered atop a piece of Stilbite by August Breithaupt in 1818. He named it “Euzeolite”, but his discovery was very short lived. Four years later in 1822, H.J. Brooke “officially” discovered this mineral and named it after the famed English mineralogist John Henry Heuland. The majority of specimens on the market today come out of India and Iceland, although more red colored Heulandite has been popping up on the market from Northern Italy and Scotland.","Meaning & Energy":"Heulandite helps you gain access to the deepest parts of your heart, while reaffirming its connection to your emotional body. It brings out the daunting experiences and emotions we have felt the need to suppress for so long and allows one to finally stand up and face them. Heulandite provides one with the courage and willpower to finally let go of these emotions and stresses. As the weight gets released from atop one’s shoulders, their daily environment will also provide one the necessary space for growth. Soon you may notice yourself eliminating toxic habits and people out of your daily interactions, while replacing them with people and habits that better suit this “new” you. Heulandite gives one their love back and urges you to interject it into every aspect of who you are. Allow the ones closest to you to become infatuated with this new outlook you have on life. One may soon notice a positive change in the ones around them, as they may too start caring about their personal needs and desires. Before you know it, you have created a healing chain that was started by your own self interest. This stone should be an example of why you must listen to your intuition and follow the path of our spirit guides. Heulandite is not here to push you in a certain direction, it is merely here to clear up the paths and show you your own potential."},"props":{"Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Life Path":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/life-path","Living in the Present Moment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/living-in-the-present-moment","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Nourishing and Rejuvenation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nourishing-and-rejuvenation","Nuturing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nuturing","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Passion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/passion","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Physical Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/physical-healing","PTSD":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ptsd","Purification":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/purification","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Self-Discipline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discipline","Selflessness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/selflessness","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Determination":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/determination","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Breaking Addictions":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/breaking-addictions","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Claiming Wholeness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/claiming-wholeness","Compassion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/compassion","Consciousness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/consciousness","Decisiveness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/decisiveness","Elimination Toxins":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/elimination-toxins","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Grounding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grounding","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/3179/conversions/Heulandite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/3179/Heulandite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Hiddenite.wav","Planets":["Earth"],"Chakras":["Heart"],"Zodiacs":["Cancer","Virgo","Capricorn","Aquarius","Pisces"],"Elements":["Water","Earth"],"Colors":["Green","Colorless","Yellow","Pale Yellow","Brass-Yellow","Olive Green "],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Parent Property":[],"id":"hiddenite","relURL":"/crystals/hiddenite","name":"Hiddenite","Formula":"Unknown","Hardness":{"min":1,"max":1},"Related":[{"Pargasite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pargasite"},{"Green Kyanite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/green-kyanite"},{"Orange Selenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/orange-selenite"},{"Gaspeite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/gaspeite"},{"Vesuvianite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/vesuvianite"},{"Mordenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/mordenite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Hiddenite":"Hiddenite is an extremely rare aluminium lithium silicate mineral and member of the Spodumene family.

Vibrations of happiness, joy, and self appreciation begin to imbue your entire body and push you towards your soul’s true mission. As you become more in touch with who you truly are, so will the people around you. Through this betterment of oneself, loved ones around you may begin to better themselves. Thus, you are passively channeling the true power of Hiddenite, which will forever linger within you!"},"props":{"Love &

Himalayan Mountains. This mountain range runs through the countries of Nepal and Bhutan, as well as creating the border between India and China. These unique crystals can form in a variety of different sizes and shapes; such as prismatic, tabular, clusters, and skinny needle-like points. This Quartz variety is extremely fragile, as some of the matrix it forms on is brittle enough to break in your hand. Himalayan Quartz can also have inclusions of other metals or minerals within, thus causing the color to change. The most popular variety is the “Smoky” Himalayan Quartz caused by natural radiation within the Earth. Iron can cause the color to change from clear, to yellow, and light pink (also known as Samadhi Quartz) which is believed to be from traces of phosphate or aluminum. Hematite inclusions give this mineral a red shade that is found towards the point of each crystal!","Rare Extraction":"This mineral is extremely hard to get a hold of due to most localities being at such high and steep elevations. Machinery cannot be used to unearth these minerals, thus causing each individual specimen to be hand-extracted. Only so many can be pulled from the ground at once, which then leads to the dangerous trek down to the base camp. Throughout this process some Quartz is damaged or even completely destroyed. Even more devastating is the loss of human life in regards to individuals who could not survive the harsh conditions on the tallest mountain peaks in the world.","Meaning & Energy":"Himalayan Quartz works as any other Quartz crystal, except for the energy it releases. This variety offers one an extremely high vibration to work with and can elevate their consciousness to newer heights. Some practitioners also believe in the ability for this mineral to help access one’s past lives through the process of deep channeling. Either way, it’s one of the more powerful forms of Quartz that we recommend!"},"props":{"Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Psychic

Calcite comes from the Greek word ‘Calix’ meaning lime and is one of the most abundant minerals on earth. The most significant deposit for Honey Calcite is located in Mexico.","Meaning & Energy":"This mineral resonates with the Root, Solar, and Third-Eye chakras creating a powerful trifecta of personal will and creation. The golden warmth of this crystal is felt upon first touch, providing the user with a link to Mother Earth's energies. This strong connection is great for accomplishing high-effort tasks and projects. When our personal will is rooted, we are more inclined to push ourselves to the finish line. The hardest part of doing something is getting started, and Honey Calcite encourages us to get up and get going.","Jumpstart Your Projects":"If you are just starting a new project, we recommend writing out your major challenges and problems on a piece of paper in front of you. Meditate with Honey Calcite either at your base or on your Third Eye envisioning golden rays of refreshing energy radiating from your entire being. You are a creative being that is bursting with ideas and plans. Honey Calcite will help you focus those energies on the thoughts that are most important.

It's commonly found with a color scheme consisting of chalky white with black veins running throughout. However it can also be seen as brown or even colorless. Howlite was first discovered in 1868 near the town of Windsor, Nova Scotia. Henry How (famed Canadian chemist and geologist) was alerted of an odd mineral that had occurred in a gypsum mine close to his office at nearby King’s College. He investigated this unusual crystal and determined it to be a completely new mineral. He originally named it “silicoborocalcite”, a reference to it’s believed chemical structure at the time. After his death, it was later renamed in his honor by James Dwight Dana (famed American geologist and volcanologist) to “Howlite”. Aside from its original discovery in Nova Scotia, Howlite can also be found in Germany, Serbia, Turkey and the United States. There are two states with very important deposits in the United States which are California and Nevada. Both places have the only mines in the world where Howlite has been found in crystallized form. This occurrence was monumental for the geology community, confirming its highly rumored existence.","Imitation Stone":"This mineral is often used as an “imitation stone” because it is dyed a variety of colors to resemble other minerals. Most often, it is used to make “fake” Turquoise so that it can be used as jewelry. Due to Turquoise having a low hardness level and brittle qualities, it's impossible to work with unless a matrix is backing it. That’s when someone decided to start dying Howlite and selling it as if it had been strengthened due to mass formations. This was a complete lie, but the mineral market took that fallacy and ran with it. Nowadays, it's very common to see dyed Howlite at gem shows, rock shops, and even jewelry stores. To avoid purchasing this man-altered mineral, we recommend immediately looking for an unnatural artificial color as well as checking it’s hardness levels.","Meaning & Energy":"Howlite is a stone of emotional healing that contains vibrations directly resonating with one’s root and crown chakras. This is a unique combination, with Howlite opening up portals of entry on opposite points of the etheric body. Your root chakra becomes fully connected to Mother Earth and all the energy she provides, while staying in direct contact with your higher self. These connections happening at the same time are extremely rare, thus exposing the power Howlite harness within. This energy is very potent and becomes imbued within the user upon first touch. One will initially notice a sense of calm energy overcoming them, easing that unnecessary “weight” off your shoulders and allowing you to stand tall. Not only do your confidence levels begin to rise, but also your inner strength begins to awaken once more. Howlite reminds us of the power we hold and urges one to use, channel, and harness this energy towards individual self-healing. This stone is here to nurture and enlighten one's heavenly body, while showing you the capabilities your soul can offer this planet.","Grief & Mourning":"A trait not often spoken about is Howlite’s ability to fully help one cope and heal from trauma, grief, mourning, PTSD, anxiety and depression. Aside from bringing one's inner strength to the forefront during this time, it also helps one slowly rebuild their emotional body. During times of distress, Howlite grounds all of our energy and allows our mind to maintain a sense of clarity. This is vital for making rational decisions that can better suit one's day to day healing. We recommend wearing or carrying a piece daily and tapping into its energy whenever it's needed. Howlite is an emotional talisman that is here to show one that growth and new life are possible, no matter the pain one has beared."},"props":{"Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Balance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balance","Creativity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creativity","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Confidence":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/confidence","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Physical Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/physical-healing","Attunement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Consciousness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/consciousness","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/higher-self","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Attunement With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement-with-higher-realms","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Grief and Mourning":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grief-and-mourning"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/70/conversions/ee1e96ce4e64972b224f8aee5c2e9f8e-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/70/ee1e96ce4e64972b224f8aee5c2e9f8e.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Hypersthene.wav","Parent Property":[],"Zodiacs":["Virgo","Libra","Pisces","Scorpio"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Colors":["Green","Grey","Black"],"Elements":["Fire","Water"],"Planets":["Pluto"],"Chakras":["Crown","Third Eye","Throat","Heart","Solar Plexus","Sacral","Root"],"id":"hypersthene","relURL":"/crystals/hypersthene","name":"Hypersthene","Formula":"(Mg, Fe)SiO3","Hardness":{"min":5.5,"max":6},"Related":[{"Heliodor":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/heliodor"},{"Bolivianite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/bolivianite"},{"Crazy Lace Agate":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/crazy-lace-agate"},{"Healer's Gold":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/healer-s-gold"},{"Axinite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/axinite"},{"Limonite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/limonite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Hypersthene":"Hypersthene, also known as Ferrosilite or Spectrolite, is an iron magnesium silicate crystal and member of the Pyroxene group of minerals. Its crystal system is orthorhombic and can be found in the form of masses, grains, flakes, and small prismatic crystals. The color composition is usually a shade of green, black or brown with a flash of iridescence (also known as a “cat’s eye”). Hypersthene can usually be found within feldspar deposits around the world. Important locations are spread throughout Canada, Australia, China, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, Norway, and the United States.","Meaning & Energy":"Hypersthene is a potent life talisman that promotes self-love & satisfaction, independence, strength, and endurance. One’s entire chakra column opens up and forces one to prioritize what's most valuable in their life. Instead of your mental state being concerned about what's next, Hypersthene redirects your concentration internally. This allows you to reflect, observe, and understand what it is your body (both physical and mental) truly needs. For most people, their narrow mental capacity simply does not allow them to understand themselves. The mind is usually too distracted to see an issue or is being medicated in the form of a vice (drugs, alcohol, etc.). This cycle can continue for years or in some cases lifetimes.","Better Yourself With Hypersthene ":"To avoid this lifetrap, we recommend constant meditation, exercise, and the desire to better yourself. Try working with numerous transformative stones (such as Labradorite, Covellite , Rhyolite, Orthoclase, Astrophyllite) in addition to Hypersthene to retrain the mind. Self-reflection can sound scary at times and sometimes it is. Only through time and energy can you not only make a difference on yourself, but also the loved ones around you. You must truly believe in the bigger picture and understand the importance of your life mission!"},"props":{"Life

It is believed that the Vikings used this mineral as a navigator because of its light-polarizing ability, allowing them to always be able to find the sun no matter the weather.

The crater is known as the Gardnos Crater, and is located in Buskerud, Norway. The meteorite was estimated to be 650-1000 feet in size and created a crater of over 3 miles wide. Upon impact, the existing bedrock was melted down and fractured. The meteorite was carrying an extraterrestrial (E.T.) mineral within, and infused Earth’s surface during the impact. This new combination of minerals has since become known as Impactite.","Meaning & Energy":"Impactite assists one on their path towards self-totality, helping maintain a clear and conscious chakra system. When one of our chakras is under distress or blocked, it affects our entire way of being. One’s emotions and mental attitude will not match up, resulting in an uneasy feeling slowly imbuing your body. Impactite’s energies raise one’s mental state to provide exceptional awareness within. By holding this stone and relaxing your mind, one will surely be able to notice what chakra doesn’t match up. Take your piece of Impactite and place it directly over that area. Continue pursuing a clear and positive mind while visualizing galactic energy seeping through your pores. The energy the E.T. mineral radiates is something no one has ever felt or experienced before. One’s self-healing and nurturing capabilities will quickly speed up when able to fully tap into Impactite’s energies. One can be meditating for mere minutes and feel a complete difference in themselves and emotional body. An etheric shield becomes built around your aura when finally attuning yourself to the energies of the cosmos. One will feel fearless and have a renewed “zest” within themselves. Soon you will see a higher version of yourself being channeled through your body. When you are truly connected to your consciousness, anything is possible.","Moldavite Similarities":"Impactite and it’s underlying vibrations are similar to that of the infamous “Moldavite Flush”, which occurs when working with another impact stone called Moldavite. This experience is the complete draining of negative emotions one continues to carry with them, even after acknowledging how unnecessary it is. Try meditating with these stones together to have the ultimate emotional roller coaster one may need to free themselves. Place these minerals at points of the body that you believe will serve you best. Allow yourself to fall into a deep meditation and see what journey these E.T. stones are capable of.","Strong Vibrations":"Be advised that both these minerals are very strong and should be used with extreme caution, whether together or separate. We recommend these crystals for higher level practioniors, but we do welcome anyone to experience them together. Just have heavy grounding stones and other protective stones nearby. If the energy becomes too much, place these stones away from one another and out of your immediate area. Continue practicing when you feel capable of doing so, since you are adjusting your energy levels to that of another world."},"props":{"Leadership":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/leadership","Nourishing and Rejuvenation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nourishing-and-rejuvenation","New

& Origin of Imperial Topaz":"Imperial Topaz, also known as Golden Topaz, is an aluminum silicate fluoride hydroxide mineral that crystallizes in the form of small prismatic crystals. The color is usually a dark orange that may be semi-transparent, but can also be seen as light red-orange-yellow as well. This color of Topaz can occur naturally, although it is extremely rare. This has led to the market being flooded with heat treated and dyed Colorless Topaz which is being sold as natural Imperial Topaz. As stated in the Colorless Topaz article, it is extremely important to know who you are buying your Topaz crystals from. Especially Imperial Topaz, because it is the most challenging color to identify whether or not it's been treated or not. One suggestion is to look at the piece very closely and examine every small crevice. If it looks too perfect and extremely pure at a lower than average Topaz price range, it has more than likely been treated. To avoid these infuriating purchases, find out as much information as possible on your Topaz dealer’s goods. Most natural Imperial Topaz comes from a few towns in the Minas Gerais region of Brazil. Specifically, the towns of Ouro Prêto, Dom Bosco, Rodrigo Silva, and Saramenha are all heavy producers of natural Imperial Topaz. Aside from Brazil, this Topaz variety is also found in Chelyabinsk, Russia, and the Topaz Mountains in western Utah.","Meaning & Energy":"Imperial Topaz is one of the most powerful manifestation stones you can get your hands on. It has a direct link to one’s solar plexus chakra, activating and enhancing one’s personal will. When the driving force behind all we do is awoken and fully activated, anything becomes possible. Our focus, determination, and confidence reach an all time high when resonating with Imperial Topaz’s energy. One becomes a higher, more powerful version of themselves when aligned with this magical stone. It's the perfect crystal for helping you get things done and also pushing your mind into a phase of longevity. This allows you to harness every ounce of energy you have and to channel it directly towards the task at hand. One will not be able to rest their mind or body until their soul is fully pleased.","Meditating With Imperial Topaz":"Try placing a specific intention or goal you have within your Imperial Topaz piece. Let it be a daily reminder of how far you’ve come and just how much further you plan on going. Meditate with this crystal directly over your solar plexus chakra and allow its energies to absorb into your body. Keep your eyes closed and repeat your “dream” mantra in your head while envisioning every outcome. During these subconscious experiences, it’s important to absorb every sight, smell, and detail within these visions. All of these combined factors remind your brain that it is in fact possible to achieve your goal. This exercise helps raise one’s confidence levels and will show you the strength you possess within. You are stronger than you think and Imperial Topaz will help one channel their inner fortitude for the world to see.","Crystal Pairings":"We recommend meditating with Garnet and Imperial Topaz together. These two minerals bring out one's inner “fire” and connect them to Mother Earth. This connection helps one stay grounded and provide complete tunnel vision while hard at work accomplishing your dreams. This combination of minerals truly keeps your focus and drive going, with less time being distracted or feeling drained. These crystals together can make any dream or vision a reality. They remind us that our work ethic, confidence level, and our desire to grow will take us places others only dream about."},"props":{"Power":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/power","Personal Will":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/personal-will","Peace of

This mineral can also be found in Namibia, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Kenya, the United States, Madagascar, Pakistan, and Malawi.","Meaning & Energy":"Indicolite activates and aligns one’s throat and third eye, creating a strengthened channel between the two. Inner visions and unique psychic abilities become activated, allowing one to understand the messages behind them. Your communication skills will enhance and push you to become more in touch with your ideas and emotional state. The messages and visions you experience when working with Indicolite can be easily digested and communicated into this physical realm. One will be able to remember the minor details in their dreams, thus being able to discuss and dissect them with the ones who know you the most.","Channeling Throug Your Third Eye":"For increasing the strength of one's dream state, try placing this crystal directly over your third eye.

Merlin was a supposed mythological creature created in the 12th century around the time of King Arthur. His name derives from the Welsh folk legend Myrddin Wyllt. Merlin was a druidic shapeshifter, who harnessed the power of magic to cast spells. He was the son of the Devil and servant of God. Stories of Merlin range from battling dragons to reading prophecies into the future.","New Age Trinket":"In our opinion, there is little doubt as to why we recently found this stone. It is our belief that Mystic Merlinite is a true new-age trinket. This awakening amulet is here to unlock our consciousness and remove it from the day-to-day concerns. These daily irritants trap one’s mind to focus on things that are not meaningful. This stone helps us take a step back to summon our true potential to this physical realm. You will notice a magical effect being placed upon you to harness the power that lies deep within. The result will be your consciousness rising to new levels.","Meaning & Energy":"Mystic Merlinite is one of the newest meditation tools we all should have with us. Having this stone in your presence will help soften your aura and replenish your vibratory field. This readjustment will further your understanding of yourself and how to access your unique characteristics. For example, with a clear and conscious chakra system, you can use Mystic Merlinite’s energies to better expand your mind and third eye. A great stone to use with Mystic Merlinite is Iceland Spar (Clear Calcite). This transparent Calcite invokes clarity of the mind and enhances your inner vision to understand even the smallest of details throughout your travels."},"props":{"Anger & Stress":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anger-stress","Emotional Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-healing","Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Dreams":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dreams","Creativity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creativity","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Past Lives":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/past-lives","Clairvoyance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clairvoyance","Alignment of Chakra":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/alignment-of-chakra","Balancing Polarities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balancing-polarities","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Lucid Dreaming":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/lucid-dreaming"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/311/conversions/DSC00341-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/312/conversions/DSC00340-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/311/DSC00341.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Infinite.wav","Planets":["Earth"],"Chakras":["Heart","Solar Plexus","Sacral","Root"],"Zodiacs":["Gemini"],"Elements":["Earth"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Colors":["Yellow","Brass-Yellow","Pale Yellow","Brown","Green","Olive Green ","Venusian-Green","Grey"],"id":"infinite","relURL":"/crystals/infinite","name":"Infinite","Formula":"Mg3(Si2O5)(OH)4","Hardness":{"min":3,"max":6},"Related":[{"Serpentine":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/serpentine"},{"Rhodonite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/rhodonite"},{"Atlantisite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/atlantisite"},{"Eudialyte":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/eudialyte"},{"Hiddenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/hiddenite"},{"Fuchsite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/fuchsite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Infinite":"Infinite is the name given to a special gray-green Serpentine from South Africa.

It was first reported in 1807 by A.G. Werner. The name comes from the Greek word meaning “Violet”, due to one of the many vibrant colors Iolite was first seen as containing. Other colors of Iolite rangees from blue, brown, grey to green, yellow, or violet. Iolite has been referred to as the “violet stone”, due to it’s healing and unlocking capabilities of the third eye and crown chakras.","Meaning & Energy":"Its a stone that takes users on an inner path to their deep inner self. Iolite carries beautiful violet-blue energy that activates and clears the third eye allowing vision, communication, and awareness from higher vibrational dimensions. Many shamans use Iolite in their rituals and meditation sessions for not only the inner journey it brings, but also because of it’s healing properties. Iolite strengthens the connection between the third eye and the heart, helping to heal old wounds that are weighing on one's chest. Iolite is a stone that challenges users by bringing you to areas that you’ve once feared, and pushing you forward attempting to dispel that said fear. Iolite will help to awaken the psychic abilities we all possess, showing us our true past life experiences.","Crystal Pairings":"When it comes to users desiring monetary success, Iolite works well with Peridot and Citrine. Hematite, Jet. Garnet will help users ground themselves while working with Iolite. This is highly recommended due to the strength of the Iolite's vibrations. Some users who are new to working with Iolite will occasionally have issues of feeling “out of body”, so carrying a grounding stone with you is highly recommended.

It is estimated to be around 3.7-3.8 billion years old and for a short while in 2016, was the oldest fossil of a living organism ever discovered on Earth. This was superseded a year later by the discovery of microorganisms in the Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt, located in Quebec, Canada. The fossilized layers of Isua are usually alternating in colors, between grey, black, tan, and beige. It's one of the more unique minerals in regards to it’s appearance that we’ve ever seen. No one has officially been given credit for the finding of this rock belt formation, although it is the subject of constant study and analysis. As more ice and snow around this area begins to slowly melt, we are furthering our understanding of how and when our planet became habitable for life.","Meaning & Energy":"This mineral holds so many secrets of ancient Earth and the energies it once radiated. Chaos, harmony, peace, mayhem, love, destruction, and life all in one singular crystal. Isua takes one’s consciousness back in time to a place no physical being is capable of. A period of early evolution with raw, pure energy existing on Earth’s surface. Isua takes your soul to a place beyond its own existence (no matter how many lives you’ve lived) in search of purity, prophetic knowledge, and strength. It is a true talisman of the mind, body, and soul, with endless capabilities to provide one true ascension. To access this ancient energy, one must first accustom themselves to the energies that radiate off Isua. It is not a stone for the sensitive and can be very overwhelming at first. All levels of crystal practitioners must attune their energies to this mineral and slowly add it into their meditation routines. Carry a piece with you to accustom your subconscious body to the energies your aura will soon come to be filled with. Once comfortable and ready to move forward, slowly begin to add Isua into your meditation sessions. Try placing Isua on your third eye to directly absorb the ancient energy into the pineal gland. This will help one raise their entire mental awareness and allow the soul to more easily “escape” the physical body. Much like astral travel, the soul must leave the body to retrieve this ancient knowledge. One must allow their mind and consciousness to become that one singular being and only then has the Isua journey just begun.","Rapid Transformation":"The transformation one will go through when working with Isua can be drastic. One may notice themselves beginning to shed old layers and reducing things in their environment that no longer serve them. It helps one accept the ongoing growth that has taken place and push them to continue moving in that direction. Naturally, humans want to fight change, even if the end result is something you truly love. Isua is here to provide comfort during this time of change and expose individuals to new opportunities and interests. One will begin to notice themselves taking action and doing what is best for their current well being. This is a clear indication of one asserting control directly into their life path, without distractions or societal expectations swaying their mental state. None of this will occur overnight or in one meditation session with Isua. One must continuously use Isua and fully harmonize with this mineral if they truly want to see transformation and alignment of their higher self."},"props":{"Abundance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/abundance","Action":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/action","Adventures":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/adventures","Alignment

It is most commonly found in shades of pale to dark green and typically contains yellowish hues, but can also display hues of  white, grey, brown, and black. Nephrite is most commonly found in New Zealand within Serpentine deposits and along the edges of water sources. It’s also commonly found in Australia, Russia, China, Taiwan, Canada, Zimbabwe and USA (Alaska and Wyoming). The second mineral known as \"Jade\" is Jadeite, which is a sodium aluminum silicate with a hardness of 6.5-7. Jadeite has a less glassy luster than Nephrite; appearing more dull and waxy with more vivid colorations. Although it is most commonly found in green, it can also occur in white, orange, yellow, grey, black, and lavender formations. Its first recorded discovery was by conquistadors in Mesoamerica and was brought back to Europe. The primary source of Jadeite is Burma but it also has localities in Japan, Guatemala, Kazakhstan, Canada, Turkey, Cuba, Russia, South America, and USA. The best way to distinguish between Nephrite and Jadeite is through a \"chime test\". When tapped with a hard object (chime) Nephrite will let out a musical tone while Jadeite will not."},"props":{"Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Dreams":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dreams","Love & Relationships":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/love-relationships","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Physical Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/physical-healing","Abundance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/abundance","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Transmutation of Negative Energies":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transmutation-of-negative-energies","Longevity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/longevity","Connection with Nature":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/connection-with-nature","Astral Travel":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/astral-travel","Elimination Toxins":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/elimination-toxins","Lucid Dreaming":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/lucid-dreaming","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Fertility and Pregnancy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/fertility-and-pregnancy"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/5982/conversions/Jade-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/5982/Jade.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Japan%20Law%20Twin.wav","Chakras":["Earthstar","Root","Sacral","Solar Plexus","Heart","Throat","Third Eye","Crown","Etheric"],"Planets":["Mercury","Venus","Earth","Mars","Jupiter","Saturn","Uranus","Neptune","Pluto","Sun","Moon"],"Zodiacs":["Aries","Taurus","Gemini","Cancer","Leo","Virgo","Libra","Scorpio","Sagittarius","Capricorn","Aquarius","Pisces"],"Elements":["Storm"],"Colors":["Colorless","Smokey","Orange","Yellow","White"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Parent Property":[],"id":"japan-law-twin","relURL":"/crystals/japan-law-twin","name":"Japan Law Twin","Formula":"SiO2","Hardness":{"min":7,"max":7},"Related":[{"Blue Topaz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/blue-topaz"},{"Angel Aura Quartz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/angel-aura-quartz"},{"Yellow Opal":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/yellow-opal"},{"Tree Agate":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/tree-agate"},{"Preseli Bluestone":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/preseli-bluestone"},{"Isua":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/isua"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Japan Law Twin":"Japan Law Twin, also known as Weiss Law Twin, La Gardette Law Twin, and Twinning Crystal Quartz, is an extremely rare Quartz variety. It is defined as having two crystals that meet at an angle of 84°33'; as well as having parallel prismatic faces (resulting in a “V” formation). The main market name (Japan Law) comes from the exceptionally high end specimens that come out of Japan, even though this mineral was originally discovered in La Gardette, France. This is where the original name (La Gardette Law Twin) came from and occurred in 1829 by a German mineralogist named Mr. Weiss. Since then, this quartz variety has been found in a smoky formation and even in more rare, Citrine versions. Both these varieties are extremely valuable and can only be found in a few locations around the world, with the main source being in Namibia.","What Makes it a Japan Law Twin?":"Two different shaped minerals can be found under the class of “Law Twins”. These being the “V” shaped formation, as well as a more “harsh” and “sharp” variety that strongly resembles a small butterfly (some also argue a tiny symmetrical heart). Both configurations can range in size from .5”-12” in length, with some specimens weighing in as much as 10 pounds!","Meaning & Energy":"Japan Law Twin shares the same energy of all Quartz crystals, as well as any inclusion it may contain (smoky or citrine). As one continues to work with this unique mineral, they will see the enhancement and enlightenment they receive as they channel the benefits of the twins. One’s mind is able to maintain a sense of clarity while cementing your place in the spirit realm. Instill all the trust you carry in this crystal and allow it to be the changing factor in your life as you follow your soul’s mission.

decaying wood under extreme pressure. The wood comes from a family of Araucariaceae trees which are an ancient group of cone-bearing trees that existed during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. It has been used in history as far back as 10,000 B.C. with a carving of a larva discovered near the Venuses of Petersfel. The finest specimens are found on England’s northeast coast, and the Roman Empire used to import it from York. This compressed stone can be found not only in the United Kingdom but the United States, Spain, Turkey, Portugal, Italy, France, Canada, Cambodia, and Australia.","Soft Jet vs Hard Jet":"Two different forms of Jet can be found, both soft and hard. Soft Jet occurs when carbon is compressed with freshwater, while hard Jet forms with compressed carbon and saltwater. Jet is technically not a mineral, but a Mineraloid, which is a naturally occurring substance that seems like a mineral but does not demonstrate structural crystals.","Meaning & Energy":"Jet has been used by people mourning for centuries. It works very well in drawing out the negative energies that surround your aura. Jet acts as a purifier, attempting to draw and dispel any unwanted energy while at the same time ushering in positivity. The Romans believed it would protect them from evil entities, especially the “Evil Eye”. Part of the lore behind Jet is it being considered a stone of luck. For centuries it was said to bring luck to anyone who would carry it.

These mountains border China and Pakistan, with the stone itself only found on the Pakistan side to date. This crystal is extremely rare and has a mining process, unlike any other stone. The heavy snow, high altitude, and limited resources in the area make the value of this stone incredibly high. Many theories about the stones origin and creation are debated, but the common belief is that the granite (made up of Quartz, Muscovite, Biotite, and sodium plagioclase) hardened and the Azurite droplets then occurred during a secondary melt (a melt that happened after the primary stone hardened). There’s speculation that it's even true Azurite due to white granite and Azurite never before being recorded together. In many cases, there are tiny droplets of Malachite spotted throughout the white granite. It too was formed during a secondary melt, but can only be seen up close on a majority of specimens.","Meaning & Energy":"K-2 opens and unlocks our third eye and crown chakra. This stone helps strengthen the third eye to enhance psychic abilities on all levels (lucid dreaming, astral projection, telepathy) and assist in the opening of the crown chakra. When our crown becomes open, endless amounts of higher knowledge soon begin to spiral down within us. The third eye connection to the crown is vital at this point, and aids in “seeing” what this knowledge truly means. This information is here to serve you on the path to your higher self, and K-2 is the key to accessing this knowledge.","Meditating With K2":"We recommend placing a piece of K-2 on your third eye while meditating to help strengthen it during this very communicative process. If you begin to feel comfortable enough and attuned after multiple sessions, The Council recommends placing a very high-frequency stone such as Phenacite, Iceland Spar (Clear Calcite), or a Herkimer Diamond on the top of your head. Doing so will access very high vibrations, energies, and messages from angelic beings. The reinforced connection between the crown and third eye will make the understanding of this knowledge easier."},"props":{"Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Ascension":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ascension","Leadership":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/leadership","Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/higher-self","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Angelic Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/angelic-communication","Attunement With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement-with-higher-realms","Communication With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-higher-realms","Communication with Guides":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-guides","Channeling and Grounding Higher Vibrations":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/channeling-and-grounding-higher-vibrations","Astral Travel":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/astral-travel","Interdimensional Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/interdimensional-communication","Lucid Dreaming":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/lucid-dreaming","Alignment with the Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/alignment-with-the-higher-self","Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality","Life Path":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/life-path"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/126/conversions/k2-%282500px%29-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/127/conversions/k2-upclose-%281000px%29-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/126/k2-%282500px%29.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Kambaba%20Jasper.wav","Colors":["Olive Green ","Venusian-Green","Green","Black"],"Parent Property":[],"Chakras":["Heart","Root"],"Planets":["Earth"],"Elements":["Earth"],"id":"kambaba-jasper","relURL":"/crystals/kambaba-jasper","name":"Kambaba Jasper","Formula":"n{SiO2} p{Na(AlSi3O8)} q{Ca(Al2Si2O8)} r{K2O}","Hardness":{"min":6.5,"max":7},"Related":[{"Actinolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/actinolite"},{"Chrysoprase":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/chrysoprase"},{"Yellow Jade":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/yellow-jade"},{"Garnierite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/garnierite"},{"Dragi (Dragon) Jade":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/dragi-dragon-jade"},{"Orange Aventurine":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/orange-aventurine"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Kambaba Jasper":"Kambaba Jasper, also known as Kambaba Stone or Green Stromatolite Jasper, is an extremely old stone dating back to 3 billion years ago. The green and black swirling color pattern can have many experienced crystal collectors confusing this stone with Malachite or Nebula Stone. Kambaba Jasper is actually not a Jasper, but rather a fossil. This stone is classified as a stromatolite, which refers to the clump of fossilized algae that created this mineral. One of the special fossils within Kambaba Jasper is actually Cyanobacteria, which is believed to have helped create the first oxygen atmosphere here on earth many moons ago. Other minerals within this special combination of stones are usually Quartz, Feldspar, Cristobalite, and Albite. The exact discovery date and locality of this stone is unknown, however it can be found in South Africa, Madagascar, and the small sea in which divides the two. The origin of the stone’s name is also heavily debated, with the leading theory suggesting Kambaba Jasper was named after Cheitharol Kambaba. Cheitharol Kambaba is the court chronicle of the kings of Manipur, India and has been around for thousands of years.","Meaning & Energy":"Kambaba Jasper is a very energizing stone that activates our root and heart chakras. It helps provide much needed healing to the heart and calming of negative emotions such as guilt, trauma, grief, jealousy, anger, and sadness. This crystal helps one achieve emotional balance throughout the day, and helps keep one “cool” during times of distress. Kambaba Jasper acts as a teacher and life coach, helping you get through some of the toughest emotional experiences you’ve had to deal with. This stone pushes us to release the weight pushing down on our chest, right back into the atmosphere. Show the universe that you will not tolerate being “stuck” in emotional disarray anymore. Kambaba Jasper’s powers are strong enough to finally put you back in the driver's seat of your life. Simple things such as socializing, working with colleagues, and even forming long lasting relationships (sexual & non-sexual) will feel natural and easier than ever before. This special combination of minerals helps one feel comfortable with themselves and their surroundings. "},"props":{"Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Living in the Present Moment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/living-in-the-present-moment","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Nourishing and Rejuvenation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nourishing-and-rejuvenation","Nuturing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nuturing","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Connection with Nature":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/connection-with-nature","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Animal Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/animal-communication","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Claiming Wholeness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/claiming-wholeness","Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Empathy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/empathy","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Grounding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grounding","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/282/conversions/IMG_2146-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/7385/conversions/IMG_2146-2-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/282/IMG_2146.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Kammererite.wav","Planets":["Neptune","Uranus","Pluto"],"Chakras":["Crown","Third Eye","Throat"],"Zodiacs":["Aries","Taurus","Gemini","Libra","Scorpio"],"Elements":["Storm"],"Colors":["Purple","Red","Black","Violet"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Parent Property":[],"id":"kammererite","relURL":"/crystals/kammererite","name":"Kammererite","Formula":"Unknown","Hardness":{"min":1,"max":1},"Related":[{"Purple Jade":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/purple-jade"},{"Saussurite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/saussurite"},{"Danburite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/danburite"},{"Astrophyllite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/astrophyllite"},{"Goshenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/goshenite"},{"Blue Chalcedony":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/blue-chalcedony"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Kammererite":"Kammererite is a rare chromium-rich variety of Clinochlore and member of the Chlorite family. It crystallizes in the form of masses, pyramid-like micropoints, and hexagonal crystals. The color can range from dark red, to purple, and even violet. This depends on the amount of chromium impurities within. It was first discovered in 1841 by Nils Gustaf Nordenskiöld, a Finnish mineralogist who chose to name it after August Alexander Kämmerer. Kämmerer was a famous chemist and at the time, the mining director of St. Petersburg, Russia. Since then, it has been discovered only a handful of times in Russia, Norway, Sweden, Finland, the United States, and recently, Turkey. ","Meaning & Energy":"Kammererite is a high tiered stone that harnesses the key to unlocking your soul. It can assist in helping you rise out of your physical body. The violet rays of this stone assist in bridging the spiritual and physical worlds together. This can allow one to ascend to a higher plane of consciousness. Within these timeless realms, an experienced practitioner can navigate their spirit to endless dimensions full of knowledge. This includes access to the Akashic Records, which is an ancient astral plane that holds the truth to life and the universe. We suggest meditating with this stone directly over your third eye or crown chakra. These upper activation points of the body, when awakened together, allow one the ability to see past their third-dimensional realm.\nFor those of you who practice remote viewing, lucid dreaming, and astral recall, there are very few stones stronger than Kammererite. This mineral’s energies are most abundant in the dream realm which require your consciousness to be vibrating at a higher level. ","Inner Intuition":"Placing this stone in the room you meditate in can have profound effects on your mind. The results interject your internal frequency, aiding in the attunement of your spirit into other realms. During these experiences, one may notice increased visual clarity and understanding of the symbolic imagery you are seeing. This is a direct representation of the effects Kammererite has on your mind. Our inner intuition rises when working with this stone and transmutes significant ideology to things we will understand. This grounding effect will better your understanding of who you truly are, as well as your purpose here on Earth.\nKammererite is extremely powerful in crystal grids and has the ability to raise your internal vibration. Try placing this mineral in the center of your grid surrounded by other high energetic stones. Some of our favorites are Quartz, Selenite, Cavansite, Blue Topaz, Dumortierite, Phenacite, Covellite , and Tanzanite. We highly recommend carrying a piece on you at all times so you can raise the energy of your aura. One’s passive ability to increase their presence here on Earth will have profound effects on your growth as you move forward!\n"},"props":{"Dreams":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dreams","Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Calming and

This mineral was first discovered on the Isle of Paul near the Labrador Peninsula in Canada. It was founded by the Moravian missionary and bears the name from its location. Labradorite is renowned for its mirage of colors and display of Labradorescence. Its flash of colors can contain blue, green, yellow, orange, red, and even purple. This mineral can be found in the United States, Canada, Madagascar, Russia, Norway, and the United Kingdom. In Finland, a variation of Labradorite was discovered that displays the entire color spectrum. This special variety was given the name of Spectrolite.","Labradoressence":"Unlike most stones, the color displayed from Labradorite does not come from light reflected from the surface of this mineral. Instead, the spectrum of colors that you are seeing is caused by light reflecting off of a twinning surface within the stone. The difference in colors depends on the type of twinning surface that the light is refracting off of.","Meaning & Energy":"Labradorite harnesses the true potential of our own transformative power. Personally, it is one of the first stones that introduced us to the crystal world. If you are someone that experiences anxiety or is constantly doubting themselves, Labradorite is the stone to look to. If you are experiencing an anxiety attack, we recommend holding or rubbing a piece of Labradorite, reminding yourself that you have the power to talk yourself down from any situation. It’s hard for us to realize sometimes how powerful our minds truly are. Just as we can work ourselves up from situations, we can always calm ourselves down. We are the judge, jurors, and executioners of our own fate, so why not judge ourselves worthy of happiness and potential?","Etheric Fuel & Shield":"Part of being a practitioner of magic requires one to have the proper amulets and tools around them to conjure, transfer, and channel energies outward. Labradorite can be nicknamed “The Magicians Fuel” due to its ability to aid one as you awaken your true potential. If you find yourself in a situation where you need protection both physically and spiritually, Labradorite will aid with its barrier of luminescent light. As you create and begin to travel through the universe, act fearlessly as Labradorite will provide you with a protective cloak. No matter the size of the Labradorite, the energies will always be there to remind you of your true, radiating power."},"props":{"Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Synchronicity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/synchronicity","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Attunement With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement-with-higher-realms","Connection with Nature":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/connection-with-nature","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Creativity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creativity"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/57/conversions/2184114f900c400af4eaeee02e99db69-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/58/conversions/e19f8842b79bcacaaa2a02edf06adfc1-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/168/conversions/Labradorite-Palmstones-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/57/2184114f900c400af4eaeee02e99db69.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Lakelandite.wav","Parent Property":[],"Chakras":["Root","Heart"],"Planets":["Earth"],"Elements":["Earth"],"Zodiacs":["Leo","Virgo"],"Colors":["Black","Green"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"lakelandite","relURL":"/crystals/lakelandite","name":"Lakelandite","Formula":"n{CaMgO6Si2} p{(Ca0.7-0.9, Na0.3-0.1)[Al(Al,Si)Si2O8]}","Hardness":{"min":6,"max":6},"Related":[{"Miriam Stone (Calligraphy Stone)":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/miriam-stone-calligraphy-stone"},{"Moss Agate":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/moss-agate"},{"Truffle Chalcedony":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/truffle-chalcedony"},{"Nundoorite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/nundoorite"},{"Chiastolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/chiastolite"},{"Axinite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/axinite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Lakelandite":"Lakelandite is a unique mineral consisting of Basalt and Bytownite, a calcium rich plagioclase feldspar. It is believed to have formed around 480 million years ago in present day Cumbria, Coldbeck Falls, United Kingdom. During this time period, the area was under severe volcanic and cataclysmic activity. Over the course of around 10 million years, this volcanic activity eventually deposited a 7 kilometers thick layer of rock. It is during this time that Basalt and Bytownite became infused together, and eventually created Lakelandite.","Meaning & Energy":"The heart and root chakra become infused together when tapping into Lakelandite. One will soon discover the ancient healing energies this crystal holds and how to go about channeling it into your own self-healing routine. Simply meditating with this stone for a few minutes will show you just how potent this mineral really is. Lakelandite’s energies are extremely beneficial for those suffering from a broken heart or uncontrollable emotional patterns. As one begins to open themselves up to this stone, their connection with Mother Earth will slowly increase as well. As one becomes rooted to our planet, they will begin to project nurturing and rejuvenating energies to heal all wounds.","Releasing Unecessary Weight":"The opening of your heart and releasing of unnecessary weight is something Lakelandite is prized for. Anyone who has recently undergone a tragic event or loss of a loved one will be best suited for the healing needs from this stone. Lakelandite provides comfort and protection of one's emotional body as they mourn and grieve during this truly devastating time. The term “time heals all wounds” is absolutely inapplicable here, but Lakelandite can transition one into their new reality. This mineral is truly special and has the ability to provide love, healing protection, and strength when it is most needed. These tragic times do not last, but will remain with us forever.

You will always find Lazurite within Lapis Lazuli. However, Calcite, Pyrite, and Sodalite can also make an appearance. The name is derived from the Latin word “Lapis” meaning stone and the Persian word “lāzaward” meaning sky or heavens. In ancient times, Lapis Lazuli was incorrectly called Sapphire or the Latin word Sapphirus. The highest quality deposits are found in the Sar-e-Sand deposit in the Hindu Kush Mountains of Afghanistan's Kochka River Valley. It is important to note that unlike most minerals, Lapis Lazuli is found within caves and not traditional mines. Other localities of Lapis include the Andes in Chile, Canada, Russia, Burma, and the United States.","Be Caution of Fakes":"Lapis Lazuli is commonly faked due to the popularity its name carries in the new age movement. Aside from buying from trusted dealers, we recommend examining each piece while looking for common impurities. We suggest looking for differentials in each surface and to expect a denser weight due to its formation in a metamorphic rock. Since fake Lapis is often dyed Agate, be wary if the color is a very bright blue!","Meaning & Energy":"Lapis Lazuli is a stone that emboldens the communicative abilities between the mind, throat, and heart. One will shortly begin to find themselves radiating the truth of their emotional body. Lapis Lazuli’s energies promote heightened intellect, inner visions, and an expanded mental capacity."},"props":{"Dreams":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dreams","Balance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balance","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Clarity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clarity","Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Past Lives":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/past-lives","Luck and Good Fortune":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/luck-and-good-fortune","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Ascension":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ascension","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/higher-self","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Expansion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expansion","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Angelic Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/angelic-communication","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Communication With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-higher-realms","Communication with Guides":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-guides","Interdimensional Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/interdimensional-communication","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Lucid Dreaming":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/lucid-dreaming","Balancing Polarities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balancing-polarities"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/173/conversions/Lapis-Lazuli-2-%282500px%29-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/173/Lapis-Lazuli-2-%282500px%29.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Larimar.wav","Colors":["Light Blue","Blue"],"Planets":["Mercury","Neptune"],"Elements":["Water","Fire"],"Zodiacs":["Leo"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Chakras":["Throat"],"Parent Property":[],"id":"larimar","relURL":"/crystals/larimar","name":"Larimar","Formula":"NaCa2Si3O8(OH)","Hardness":{"min":4.5,"max":5},"Related":[{"Watermelon Tourmaline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/watermelon-tourmaline"},{"Pink Tourmaline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pink-tourmaline"},{"Thulite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/thulite"},{"Fuchsite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/fuchsite"},{"Morganite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/morganite"},{"Rosasite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/rosasite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Larimar":"Larimar, also known as Stefilia’s Stone, Atlantis Stone, and Dolphin Stone, is an extremely rare sodium calcium silicate and a member of the Pectolite family. Pectolite can be found all around the world, but only in shades of grey and white. The soft blue color of Larimar is due to the substitution of copper, instead of calcium. This special mineral was able to form in cavities of basalt rock during heavy volcanic activity. As lava was flowing, this steady stream began to pick up any and all minerals in its path and displace them. As the lava moved over cavities and dikes, minerals began to fall in and create the beautiful stone we now call Larimar. This unique mineral only has one locality and can only be found within a half square mile in the Dominican Republic, more specifically, the mountains above Baoruco. It’s commonly referred to as the “Caribbean Stone” due to the heavy presence this stone holds on all surrounding islands as well.","Meaning & Energy":"Larimar is a perfect tool for anyone who finds themselves struggling with controlling emotions and communicating how we truly feel within. This stone activates and unlocks our throat chakra and forces one to open themselves up to the loved ones around us and discuss the issues one may be dealing with. This mineral will help keep your mind in a calm state and allow for true emotions from the heart to surface. When one is able to talk through difficulties that they’re facing, one will soon realize there is a solution. Simply letting yourself hear what you have to say will help you better understand yourself and your needs. So often does our mind become foggy or polluted with unnecessary, negative thoughts. When this happens, one will never find a solution to their problems. Larimar is here to show you the inner strength you possess, and the importance to vocalize the issues we hold so close to our hearts. "},"props":{"Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Nourishing and Rejuvenation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nourishing-and-rejuvenation","Passion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/passion","Prosperity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/prosperity","Purification":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/purification","Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Self-Discipline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discipline","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Soothing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/soothing","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Trauma":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trauma","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Claiming Wholeness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/claiming-wholeness","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Compassion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/compassion","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Empathy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/empathy","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Generosity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/generosity","Grief and Mourning":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grief-and-mourning","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/291/conversions/larimar-%282500px%29-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/291/larimar-%282500px%29.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Larvikite.wav","Colors":["Light Blue","Blue","Black"],"Parent Property":[],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Zodiacs":["Cancer"],"Elements":["Water"],"Planets":["Neptune"],"Chakras":["Third Eye","Root","Solar Plexus"],"id":"larvikite","relURL":"/crystals/larvikite","name":"Larvikite","Formula":"K(AlSi3O8)","Hardness":{"min":6,"max":7},"Related":[{"Mangano Calcite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/mangano-calcite"},{"Rhyolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/rhyolite"},{"Orthoclase":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/orthoclase"},{"Orange Selenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/orange-selenite"},{"Brochantite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/brochantite"},{"Vesuvianite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/vesuvianite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Larvikite":"Larvikite is a black igneous rock made up entirely of feldspar (with small chemical composition changes) that crystallizes in the form of large masses. Within the feldspar itself, there are small silver-blueish shimmering crystals that give Larvikite it’s notoriety and fame. This eye catching “flash” is commonly referred to as the “Schiller Effect” and is believed to have been caused by Ternary Feldspar (a fancy name for feldspar that is rich in potassium, sodium, and calcium). Larvikite is believed to have formed over 298 million years ago, at an estimated depth of 18 miles below Earth’s surface (an astounding feat considering large deposits of this mineral are now breaching continental Norway). The name of this mineral comes from the local town of its original discovery; Larvik, Norway. Since then a few deposits have been discovered throughout the world, with the other major source coming out of Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada.","Meaning & Energy":"Larvikite is a stone of inner transformation that helps one better adapt to change, as well as accept and understand any benefits that may come with it. Change is constant, with the world around us forever transitioning. To personally (as well as spiritually) evolve on this planet, one must be able to withstand and “weather the storm”. Larvikite helps one access their inner strength and enables their personal willpower to go on “auto-pilot”. This will assist one through any difficult process causing constant distress. One will not need to worry about the cost of any negativity that these new surroundings may bring with them, as Larvikite fully protects one's spiritual and physical body, including your auric field.","Worry Stone":"We’ve found ourselves constantly referring to this mineral as the “worry stone”, as it is a neutralizer of one’s most powerful emotional reaction; anxiety. One will be able to live each moment without the burden of stress, while also dispelling any negative emotions that may build up throughout the day. Instead, Larvikite focuses on the positives around you and will help channel the good vibrations within. An overall powerful talisman that can benefit every aspect of your life, Larvikite is a much needed stone to add into your daily meditation sessions.

as Basalt, is a broad term for a mineral that forms when magma from volcanoes solidifies and hardens into rock. This stone is found worldwide and is one of the oldest and most abundant minerals on earth. It is challenging to acquire due to most countries making it illegal to sell or distribute. One of the primary reasons is that most volcanic rock is located on government-owned and protected property. Most Lava Rock that appears on the market today was either mined before the regulations were put into place or smuggled out of that particular country. Visiting many island countries can help one better understand how magma cools and basalt (Lava Rock) forms.","Transformation & New Beginning":"Just by glancing at any Lava Rock piece, you can see how it is a true fragment of Mother Earth. It is a tiny sliver of her physical shell yet contains some of the most abundant energy she has to offer. Lava Rock is a representation of the blood our home planet sacrificed to create a livable biome. The energy encased within Lava Rock is raw and primal. At one time, this tough stone was a free-flowing liquid that ebbed and flowed with its environment. This form of earth’s energy was so powerful it devastated anything in its path yet left a fresh layer to start anew. This is one of the many effects that this small piece of Earth can have on you. One will stop existing within this plane and transform into the primordial being that we know is within. Lava Rock pushes one to have a breakthrough and to ultimately transform their entire life. Working with this stone can bring the real you to the surface and lay fresh ground for you to plant your roots.","A Fire Inside":"All of us have a fire inside and it is our destiny to ignite it. More importantly, one must be able to find what it is that really gets you out of bed each day. These small actions describe the life that you would like to live and the massive change that's required to achieve it. Lava Rock directs your internal desires to your second brain (your gut), which houses your incredible will that is needed to maintain your happiness. Place this stone directly over your navel while meditating and allow the most delicate of energies to be pulled out by this crystal. You will know the feeling once these emotions begin to take flight. Success takes hard work and Lava Rock pulls the hard-worker out of you.","Grounding":"Our root chakra is responsible for our connection to this physical plane. By activating it through a crystal’s energy and meditation, one can root themselves and bring forth higher energies, thoughts, and feelings. As the stone’s “grounding” effect takes place, one will notice a slow release of control. This is all a part of the process to slow yourself down and live in the moment. Our heads are distracted continuously each day by nonsense and energy-wasting thoughts. Lava Rock helps extinguish those ideas and provide a clean slate for us to begin imaging from the soul.","Infusion of Essential Oils":"Lava Rock is a remarkable stone to use with your favorite essential oils. Its surface is able to hold and slightly absorb those essences. We recommend starting your meditation how you would normally, but this time hold a piece of Lava Rock infused with the oil. Take deep breaths and inhale the relaxing and healing benefits of any oil you would like. We at the Crystal Council advocate for the use of essential oils in any meditation session. Being able to use this crystal as a tool during this process is a dream come true!"},"props":{"Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Creativity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creativity","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Grounding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grounding","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Expansion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expansion","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Motivation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/motivation","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/276/conversions/Lava-Rock-%282500px%29-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/7661/conversions/Lava-Rock-%282500px%29-1-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/276/Lava-Rock-%282500px%29.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Lazulite.wav","Colors":["Light Blue","Blue"],"Parent Property":[],"Chakras":["Third Eye"],"Elements":["Wind"],"Zodiacs":["Sagittarius","Gemini"],"Planets":["Jupiter"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"lazulite","relURL":"/crystals/lazulite","name":"Lazulite","Formula":"MgAl2(PO4)2(OH)2","Hardness":{"min":5.5,"max":6},"Related":[{"Purpurite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/purpurite"},{"Hackmanite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/hackmanite"},{"Grape Agate":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/grape-agate"},{"Covellite ":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/covellite"},{"Afghanite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/afghanite"},{"Nuummite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/nuummite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Lazulite":"Lazulite is an aluminum magnesium iron phosphate that crystallizes in the form of masses and on rare occasions can be seen in small pyramidal crystal patterns. This stone can be seen in various shades of blue, although the most common color on the market is azure-indigo blue. Lazulite was first discovered back in 1795 by Martin H. Klaproth in Styria, Austria. He named it after the German word “lazurstein”, which translates to “Blue stone”. Since his discovery in Austria, Lazulite veins have been discovered all over the world. India, Sweden, Brazil, Australia, Canada, Madagascar, and the United States are just a few countries that contain an abundance of this mineral. Canada has recently been providing the world with some of the most beautiful Lazulite specimens we’ve ever seen.","Lazulite vs Lapis Lazuli":"A common misconception is that Lazulite is the primary crystal in Lapis Lazuli. Although they share similar qualities, properties, and colors, Lazulite is actually not found within Lapis Lazuli, rather it’s the mineral known as “Lazurite” that's found in it. Both share very similar spelling and may often be mistaken by experts.","Meaning & Energy":"Lazulite’s high vibrational energy immediately directs itself to one’s third eye and activates their own unique psychic abilities. This powerful mineral helps us attune to higher vibrations and assists one in becoming more comfortable with this energy each day. Working with this stone will help one gain insight into their nightly dreams and understand what the purpose and meaning of them are. Lazulite will also help one “disconnect” from the physical realm and help one during times of astral projection during sleep or deep meditation. It provides comfort in these new and unknown experiences while raising one’s mental capacity to absorb higher knowledge from spirit beings. This knowledge is here to serve us on our life path and push our souls in the direction they truly want to go in. So often in this physical world does our brain do the thinking that it leaves our hearts and souls, which contain our purest emotions, to remain silent. Working with this stone repeatedly will allow one to bring the knowledge they’ve learned down to Earth, where it can then be used in the pursuit of one's goals and desires.","Bridging the Spiritual & Phsyical Worlds":"We highly recommend carrying a piece of Lazulite with you each day if you are someone trying to bridge the spiritual and physical worlds together. Being exposed to this powerful energy daily will allow one to passively live their lives at a higher frequency. One will soon realize how strong their mind can become as well as the intuitive effects that come with carrying this stone. If you're looking for assistance to ground this new found energy, we recommend carrying Hematite and Covelite. Hematite will help pull this energy down to Earth, while Covelite will provide the extra strength needed to bridge the physical and spiritual realms together."},"props":{"Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Expansion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expansion","Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/higher-self","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Interdimensional Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/interdimensional-communication","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Living in the Present Moment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/living-in-the-present-moment","Life Path":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/life-path","Lucid Dreaming":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/lucid-dreaming","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Mental Enhancement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mental-enhancement","New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Purification":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/purification","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Bridging the Spiritual and Physical Worlds":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/bridging-the-spiritual-and-physical-worlds","Alignment with the Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/alignment-with-the-higher-self","Angelic Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/angelic-communication","Ascension":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ascension","Astral Travel":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/astral-travel","Attunement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement","Attunement With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement-with-higher-realms","Channeling and Grounding Higher Vibrations":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/channeling-and-grounding-higher-vibrations","Channeling":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/channeling","Clairvoyance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clairvoyance","Clarity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clarity","Communication With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-higher-realms","Communication with Guides":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-guides","Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality","Dreams":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dreams","Enhancing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enhancing","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/273/conversions/IMG_2320-2-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/7140/conversions/IMG_2320-2-1-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/273/IMG_2320-2.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Lemon%20Calcite.wav","Colors":["Pale Yellow","Pale Brass","Brass-Yellow","Yellow","Gold"],"Parent Property":[],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Zodiacs":["Leo"],"Elements":["Fire"],"Planets":["Sun"],"Chakras":["Solar Plexus"],"id":"lemon-calcite","relURL":"/crystals/lemon-calcite","name":"Lemon Calcite","Formula":"CaCO3","Hardness":{"min":3,"max":3},"Related":[{"Golden Mica":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/golden-mica"},{"Heliodor":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/heliodor"},{"Grenatite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/grenatite"},{"Peanut Obsidian":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/peanut-obsidian"},{"Eclogite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/eclogite"},{"Healer's Gold":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/healer-s-gold"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Lemon Calcite":"Lemon Calcite is a new variety of Calcite. It is a calcium carbonate mineral that was recently discovered in Pakistan and its color can range in just about every shade of yellow and even a full bodied gold. The range of colors are due to the amount of iron impurities within each stone. At the time of this writing (June 2020) not much of this material is on the market. Much of the raw stone has been going to experienced and artisan crafters who have begun the difficult and talent induced process of hand making shapes, skulls, obelisks, and more.","Meaning & Energy":"We’ve only recently begun working with this stone, but have already noticed the incredible effects it has on the solar plexus chakra. The energies of this stone immediately resonate in our gut and slowly begin to expand outwards in all directions, specifically our physical and emotional bodies. Our inner core will begin to activate with the arrival of this new found energy. One will then become more in touch with themselves and their true spirit. Slowly and unconsciously, Lemon Calcite sets us on a path of self examination, specifically diving to the depths of our motivation (or lack thereof), focus, confidence, and determination levels. This subconscious action allows one to become more aware of what it is that needs to be worked on and addressed. Over time if we do not initially confront the issues we are dealing with, they will begin to become a part of who we are. That doesn't have to be the case though and Lemon Calcite nearly makes it impossible to avoid the issues it has forced out into the open. Through deep meditation, one will be able to continuously work on these much needed traits. Focusing on these aspects can fundamentally change the person you become, as well as the course in which your heading.","Manifestation":"We recommend maximizing the manifestation abilities Lemon Calcite offers as well as becoming comfortable with the energies it releases. Try grasping this stone firmly and placing your most desired intention into it. Close your eyes and envision this reality coming to life, as well as the most minute details of this “visionary experience”. This is the process of creating your own universe and is the sole premise behind manifesting. Doing this repeatedly will only enhance the strength of your personal will and provide a means to achieve it. Listen to your instincts and allow your intuition to take flight each day. This will result in your mind passively vibrating at a very high level, while also being able to channel a higher tiered decision making process."},"props":{"New

also known as Lemurian Quartz, is a form of Quartz that is found in a specific locality of Brazil. The Lemurian crystals are extremely delicate in their formation and its unique property helped shape its name. When a Lemurian crystal is growing within a cluster, it can be so fragile that it will naturally fall out onto the floor of the crystal cave. When ancient communities encountered these caves and discovered the crystals waiting for them on the ground, they felt as though they were seeds of knowledge planted for the taking.","Lemuria":"There is much scientific and ethical debate about the lost city of Lemuria and the mentally advanced beings that were products of this ancient society. Lemuria was similar to Atlantis and was believed to have been a land bridge connecting Africa and India. In the early 1800s, Lemuria’s original name was given when a British zoologist Philip Lutley Sclater noted a similar species of Lemurs originating from India as well as Madagascar. This led to Phillip theorizing that a landmass must have connected the two continents at the time, calling it Lemuria. Helena Blavatsky was a Russian philosopher who after a spiritual awakening due to a near-death experience co-founded the Theosophical Society. During her writings, she theorized that humanity originated from five root races. The 3rd race arose from Lemuria and eventually spread its knowledge to landmasses nearby like Australia and Rapa Nui (Easter Island).","Meaning & Energy":"Lemurian Quartz is similar to normal Quartz except that it contains much more historic energy. Embedded in Lemurian Quartz is usually a horizontal line of fragments which are commonly referred to as “memories”. The information within each point contains powerful energies. This energy is capable of producing intelligent life to provide us with a much-needed soulful mission. These beings became very spiritual, and were more in touch with their higher selves. This connection led to their race being very intelligent, excelling in technology, ideology, and emotions. It is theorized that they were wiped out by a great flood that occurred around 12,000 years ago. If you are interested in reading more about this phenomenon we recommend checking out the book The Missing Lands by Freddy Silva.","Artifacts Left Behind":"It is our belief that these crystals were left here for the purpose of reigniting humanity's connection with the universe. Lemurian Quartz reminds us that we are our own gods and can produce whatever it is we may set our mind, heart, and soul to. Much of what we are seeking is already within us. The Lemurians were well aware that the only way forward in life is through the individual growth of one's spirit. To quote the Theosophical Society that Helena Plavatsky helped found: “il n'y a pas de religion supérieure à la vérité” which translates to “there is no religion greater than the truth”."},"props":{"Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Past Lives":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/past-lives","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Connection with Nature":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/connection-with-nature","Astral Travel":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/astral-travel","Ancient Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ancient-knowledge","Past Life Recall":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/past-life-recall","Lucid Dreaming":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/lucid-dreaming","Clearing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clearing"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/426/conversions/Lemurian-Seed-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/426/Lemurian-Seed.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://cdn.reamaze.com/audio/snapup.mp3","Parent Property":[],"Planets":["Jupiter","Neptune"],"Chakras":["Crown","Third Eye","Heart","Solar Plexus","Sacral","Root"],"Zodiacs":["Libra","Pisces"],"Elements":["Water","Storm"],"Colors":["Colorless","Grey","Purple","White","Pink"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"lepidolite","relURL":"/crystals/lepidolite","name":"Lepidolite","Formula":"KLi2Al(Si4O10)(F, OH)2 to K(Li1.5Al1.5)(AlSi3O10)(F, OH)2","Hardness":{"min":3,"max":4},"Related":[{"Unakite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/unakite"},{"Thulite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/thulite"},{"Rose Quartz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/rose-quartz"},{"Mimetite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/mimetite"},{"Green Garnet":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/green-garnet"},{"Rosasite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/rosasite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Lepdilote":"Lepidolite is a lithium-aluminum potassium mineral and one of the most commonly found members of the Mica family. This stone can be found crystallized in the form of masses, plates, aggregates, stacked sheets (also known as \"books\"), and tabular or prismatic crystals. The strong pink and purple color this stone emanates is derived from traces of Manganese impurities within the chemical makeup. Lepidolite is derived from the Greek word \"'lepidos\" for scale and \"lithos\" for stone. This crystal can be found worldwide with abundant veins spread throughout Brazil, Madagascar, Australia, Russia, Japan, Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and the United States.","Lithium and Lepidolite":"Lithium is used in society for everyday uses such as electric vehicles, batteries, and even modern medicine. Each day our world finds new and unique ways to take advantage of this magical component. Lepidolite is the most highly abundant mineral that contains lithium.","Meaning & Energy":"Lepidolite has softening energies that can affect your emotional body and keep your mental state operating in a calm manner. Our entire chakra column becomes activated and aligned when holding or connecting with this stone. Lepidolite personifies the idea of self growth so you can open up to the world around you. As troubling as it is to find happiness within, Lepidolite is a reminder that we must start somewhere, even if it's external. We commonly refer to it as the \"jumpstart stone\" as it wakes us up with a jolt of life-force energy.","Dreamers":"Although this stone resonates with all of our chakras, it helps forge a special connection between the third eye, crown, and heart chakra system. You may notice yourself becoming more in-touch with the emotions you feel within the dream realm. Additionally, you will notice having more physical experiences shortly-afterward. Lepidolite tunes our mental state to pick up on the fine details of symbolic imagery around us. This includes synchronicities that occur each day. Don't be startled if more Deja Vu moments arise! Trust yourself, your intuition and Lepidolite's energies to help guide you through this ever changing journey.","Newborn Energy":"We at the Crystal Council suggest any parent with newborns to place a large piece of Lepidolite in your child's room. Like Pink Opal, the calming energies have a special relationship with young souls and focus on love and nurturing. Often, children cry due to the lack of awareness of their surroundings. We as people have the habit of carrying these negative emotions with us from birth, and if left unchecked, can result in problems later in life ( anxiety, depression, and PTSD."},"props":{"Self-Love":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-love","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Dreams":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dreams","Love & Relationships":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/love-relationships","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Balance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balance","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Sleep":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sleep","Purification":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/purification","Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/higher-self","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Generosity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/generosity","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Lucid Dreaming":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/lucid-dreaming","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Nourishing and Rejuvenation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nourishing-and-rejuvenation"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/184/conversions/IMG_1857-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/184/IMG_1857.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Leucitite.wav","Parent Property":[],"Planets":["Earth"],"Chakras":["Crown","Third Eye","Throat","Heart","Solar Plexus","Sacral","Root"],"Zodiacs":["Cancer","Leo","Pisces"],"Elements":["Earth"],"Colors":["Grey","Black","White","Colorless"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"leucitite","relURL":"/crystals/leucitite","name":"Leucitite","Formula":"Unknown","Hardness":{"min":1,"max":1},"Related":[{"Peanut Obsidian":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/peanut-obsidian"},{"Rhyolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/rhyolite"},{"Orthoclase":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/orthoclase"},{"Mookaite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/mookaite"},{"Eclogite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/eclogite"},{"Limonite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/limonite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Leucitite":"Leucitite, also known as Leucite, is an aluminum potassium silicate mineral and member of the Feldspathoid family of minerals.

This crystal is usually found within a volcanic rock matrix (mainly Basalt) due to its creation stemming from ancient magma that cooled slowly. The color of Leucite is most commonly an ashy white, but can also be as transparent as a Diamond. They can range in size from a few millimeters to nearly a foot tall, with larger crystals being more susceptible to rapid oxidation. This mineral has very few localities around the world, with the majority of Leucite coming out of Italy, Turkey, Germany, Brazil, and the United States.","Meaning & Energy":"Leucite is a very Earth-heavy stone, making it one of the strongest grounding stones we’ve ever worked with.

Glass, also known as Libyan Gold Tektite or Great Sand Sea Glass, is a unique and nearly pure silica tektite believed to have been created from a meteorite impact 26 million years ago (although this is highly debated due to no evidence of a physical impact). This occurred over the modern day Sahara Desert in what is now western Egypt and eastern Libya. Pieces are found scattered across many square miles and range in color from a transparent yellow to a full-bodied gold. It was officially discovered in 1932 by P. Clayton, but has a long history that traces all the way back to Ancient Egypt.","King Tutenkhamen":"Relics and artifacts of this naturally made glass have been discovered amongst the ruins of Ancient Egypt and it’s robust civilization. Aside from the everyday tools and weapons which were crafted from this unique mineral, it was also revered by pharaohs and their gods. When King Tutenkhamen’s burial chamber was discovered in 1922 by Howard Carter, a very special pendant was located around the body of King Tut. Within the center of the charm was a near perfectly carved scarab (a powerful and divine manifestation amulet and symbol of Ancient Egypt.) This was a surprise discovery and for nearly a decade after, the stone’s origins and locality remained a mystery.","Meaning & Energy":"Libyan Desert Glass is a transformational stone that offers up powerful enhancing energies that directly resonate with one’s solar plexus, sacral, and third eye chakra. As one begins their own personal journey with this strange desert glass, exceptional qualities of oneself will rise from within and begin to shine. Your personal will, will soon undertake a “rebirthing” effect and be revitalized with true interstellar powers. One will notice the increased amount of control they have over themselves and their decision making abilities. Libyan Desert Glass helps one through their own ascension process and attunes their energies to that of the ether. These are the most powerful realms we humans can visit and they are filled with endless knowledge of the history of life and human existence.

Gold":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/healer-s-gold"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Limonite":"Limonite is the name given to a family of iron hydroxides (or other mixed oxides) and is one of the 3 major sources of naturally occurring iron here on Earth (Hematite and Goethite being the other 2). It can crystallize in many forms, most notably as a mass or cubic occurrence, but also as botryoidal and even pseudomorphs (secondary minerals replacing a crystal’s original compound; the word translates to “false form”). This is especially common on Pyrite and Garnet, but can occur on a variety of different minerals. Limonite is a very common mineral and can be found throughout the world, with major deposits located in Austria, France, Australia, the United States, Brazil, and the ancient island of Cyprus.","Goethite vs. Limonite":"Limonite and Goethite are very similar in color, shape, and formation. One major indicator to look for is the color. With these minerals, the depth of their hues are determined by the amount of iron within each specimen. Limonite is more brown and orange, and can even occur as a red earthy color (similar to that of clay). Goethite however, is usually silver, black, grey, and even metallic. When it comes to the way they occur, it's very similar, but their structure could not look more different. As Limonite is most notably found in mass, botryoidal or pseudomorph form, it often lacks cleavage and detail on the surface. Goethite is found as Botryoidal (and commonly pseudomorph), but will resemble Hematite before one’s mind will compare it to Limonite. It also can be seen in a bladed formation, closely resembling raw Scolecite.","Meaning & Energy":"Limonite holds us close to Mother Earth and provides the necessary strength needed to move forward during situations of stress and overwhelming anxiety. The grounding vibrations released during meditation root one to this planet while providing protection of one’s entire aura and physical body. With your eyes shut, imagine roots of a tree lightly entangling your body, binding and nurturing your daily vessel with complete, restorative energies. One’s entire emotional and etheric body will then begin to purify. Love is where it all begins, and the love for your own body and mind is the crucial piece to life we aren't taught in schools. With self acceptance, as well as putting yourself on the path of YOUR choosing, one can alter their entire life course for the better. One filled with laughter, love, joy, and happiness. This will all lead towards success (however you may determine that) and endless personal achievements. It’s not always easy to trust yourself, but Limonite’s empowering energies provide a swift adjustment. This will result in increased confidence levels in addition to better decision making capabilities. We hope you soon begin to empower others and push them to believe in themselves."},"props":{"Mastering

Pyrite is usually found within or near deposits of Lizardite, which adds value to each piece. The color of this mineral is mainly light lime green, but can also be found as very dark yellow. Lizardite was founded in 1955 by Eric James William Whittaker and Jack Zussman. They named it after the mine it was found in, the Lizard Peninsula located in Cornwall, United Kingdom. Since then it has been found in Australia, Brazil, the United States, Switzerland, Slovakia, Russia, Italy, Japan, France, and China.","Meaning & Energy":"This mineral shares very similar energies to Serpentine and activates the same chakras.

It is believed that this mineral provided ancient civilizations with their first introduction to magnetism and its powerful effects. This mineral was finally given a name in 1845 by W. Haidinger. It's the most important Iron Ore in today's society and is a leading contributor to our steel production. This mineral has a number of localities that include Portugal, Bolivia, Australia, Chile, Sweden, France, Canada, and the USA. Magnetite has also been found in a variety of meteorites that have landed on earth.","Meaning & Energy":"Magnetite is a very powerful stone that activates our entire chakra system. Working with this stone will help realign our chakras and removing any blockages that may be between them. It helps one stay grounded and connected to this earth, while also bringing down any ideas or feelings that weigh constantly on your mind. Magnetite helps attract the energy you output and is here to provide one with a “reflection” of themselves. This stone helps one see themselves from a different perspective then they’re used too, and provides one with the evidence needed to then make a change.

Obsidian is a type of naturally occurring volcanic glass formed as an extrusive igneous rock. Mahogany Obsidian can be commonly found any place where volcanic activity occurs, but the most notable localities include the countries of Mexico, Japan, Afghanistan, Brazil, and USA.","Meaning & Energy":"Mahogany Obsidian activates our lower 3 chakras and stimulates growth, sexuality, strength, creativity, passion, and protection. This powerful grounding stone works to bring thoughts and ideas into action for the sole purpose of personal growth. This crystal works to release us from our own inner limitations that restrict development of our life path. Mahogany Obsidian works to eliminate that hesitation within that is constantly weighing judgement on decisions that greatly affect your life purpose. When finally being able to push past such restriction, one will soon learn that anything is possible if your willing to take the chance. Mahogany Obsidian works to unlock and enhance all of your creative energy that has been pushed into being dormant. Creativity is much like a muscle, when you stop working it out, it will slowly fade away. This stone helps in releasing and reactivating these energies so that they may be pumped throughout the body and put to use once again. One will soon be able to express their true selves once more and be the highest version of themselves. Our emotions become reactivated and you’ll soon be able to “feel” again.

This specimen is extremely rare to see in crystallized form, but when it is, Malachite has long needle-like looking stalactites. This mineral was first reported in 1747 and was named by J.G. Wallerius after the Greek word “malache”(mallow), after its green color. Malachite commonly occurs with Azurite  and Chrysocolla grown within or on top. The rare Eilat stone is a combination of Malachite, Chrysocolla, and Turquoise. Malachite was believed to be used in ancient Egypt as early as 3000 B.C. for jewelry and ornaments. In the Middle Ages, Malachite was used for protection of the evil eye and as “medicine” for stomach ailments.","Meaning & Energy":"Malachite is one of the most important minerals for protecting against negative energies. It fills our auric fields with positivity, while simultaneously pushing all the negativity outwards. Malachite is known to create a “cloak of invisibility” around the user. This will remove you from certain confrontations and make you less susceptible to negative energies. This stone also helps with emotional balance, especially during times when people around you put their “baggage” on you. Malachite offers the willpower to confront and get past any emotional and physical blockage happening in your current life. Lastly, it helps people who lack self-confidence and self-responsibility. This powerful mineral assists in making progress on your spiritual journey and is a must-have for anyone who is constantly working on themselves. Malachite opens the heart and will allow for balance on all levels."},"props":{"Trauma":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trauma-1","Emotional Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-healing","Travel":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/travel","Balance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balance","Creativity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creativity","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Confidence":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/confidence","Clearing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clearing","Cleansing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/cleansing","Leadership":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/leadership","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Prosperity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/prosperity","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Transmutation of Negative Energies":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transmutation-of-negative-energies","Self-Discipline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discipline"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/7388/conversions/Malachite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/7388/Malachite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Maligano%20Jasper.wav","Parent Property":[],"Elements":["Earth"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Colors":["Grey","Yellow","Orange","Red","Blue"],"Zodiacs":["Virgo"],"Planets":["Earth"],"Chakras":["Crown","Third Eye","Throat","Heart","Sacral","Solar Plexus","Root"],"id":"maligano-jasper","relURL":"/crystals/maligano-jasper","name":"Maligano Jasper","Formula":"SiO2","Hardness":{"min":7,"max":7},"Related":[{"Stromatolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/stromatolite"},{"Grenatite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/grenatite"},{"Orange Aventurine":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/orange-aventurine"},{"Pink Chalcedony":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pink-chalcedony"},{"Seraphinite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/seraphinite"},{"Nellite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/nellite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Maligano Jasper":"Maligano Jasper is the name given to a recently discovered brecciated Jasper variety that was found in Indonesia around 2011-2012. The name comes from the small village it was found in on the island of Sulawesi (part of the four Greater Sunda Islands). It contains multiple different colors of Jasper (blue, red, orange, yellow, grey and beige) with veins of a greyish-silver Agate that has filled the cavities. At the time of this writing (July 2020) this stone has still yet to “take-off” on the market. In fact, many people in the geology and crystal community have never even heard of this new Jasper. We believe it is due to the inaccessibility of the deposit, as well as the limited amount that is usually pulled out of the ground. We’ve never seen large quantities of this mineral after it has been cut into slabs or as tumbling material. Those are indeed the two main ways that this mineral is sold, with rough being extremely hard to get a hold of.","Meaning & Energy":"Maligano Jasper helps one shed layers within themselves that no longer serve them. These unnecessary attributes add additional weight whether it’s emotional, mental or psychological. This will only lead to negative thought patterns and bad habits. Maligano Jasper transforms our spirit from within and provides an aura that can closely resemble a “rebirth” effect. This pushes one to not only continue shedding layers of themselves, but also to begin questioning their surroundings and interactions daily. Ask yourself, “what benefit do I get by being around these people”. Most of the time one will come to the realization that the intentions of others provide no actual benefit. This mischaracterization was most likely hidden due to one’s lack of judgement regarding others."},"props":{"Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Physical

carbonate mineral and member of the Calcite family. Its color can range from light to dark pink depending on the amount of Manganese in it. It's common to have white inclusions of Calcite within this crystal, sometimes in a banding formation. This mineral was first discovered in 1846 by A. Breithaupt in Banská, Štiavnica, Slovakia. He named it in reference to the inclusion of Manganese found within, thus setting up a debate regarding what true Mangano Calcite actually is compared to what is just simply, pink calcite. Eventually an agreement was reached and a 30% threshold of Manganese (carbonate) within the crystal structure was established. Sadly, any type of Pink Calcite sold on the market today is labeled “Mangano Calcite”, making it very hard to acquire this mineral. We recommend buying from a safe supplier or a trusted store front. One piece of advice we offer is to know where it's from, so you can better identify if a piece is authentic or not. Most Mangano Calcite on the market comes from Romania, Peru, Bulgaria, Mexico, Madagascar, Russia, Australia and Japan.","Meaning & Energy":"This special calcite variety promotes inner peace, compassion, pure love, joy, and self-healing vibrations. This is a true healer of the heart, one is able to push forward through any lingering trauma or pain that may have gone unresolved. The energies of Mangano Calcite allow one to find resolution while extinguishing the negative filled emotions within. One can then reach a sense of harmony and learn to achieve mental peace when utilizing the rejuvenating effects of this heavenly stone.","Reset Your Heart Space":"Try meditating with this stone and other powerful heart stones such as Rose Quartz, Morganite, Rhodochrosite, Kunzite, and Pink Tourmaline. Any of these stones combined with Mangano Calcite can help clear and “reset” one’s heart space. These crystals radiate enormous waves of uplifting energy that can fill one’s aura with pure positivity. Over time one will become more in touch with themselves, leading to an increase in confidence that can result in endless

& Origin of Mango Quartz":"Mango Quartz is a very rare variety of Quartz that was recently discovered in the region of Boyaca, Columbia. It’s crystal formations are like the usual Quartz structures; needle-like, prismatic, double terminated, and Japan Law. The unearthed specimens contain a completely natural orangish-yellow pigment that is located in the crystals’ points. There is still ongoing debate in the scientific and geological communities, but most signs point to the inclusion as being Halloysite (an aluminosilicate clay mineral).","\"The Emerald Czar\" Origins":"The main reason we are even discussing Mango Quartz and it’s existence today is due to a man named Don Victor Carranza, also known as the “Emerald Czar”. He became a very wealthy businessman that owned many Emerald mines throughout Colombia, a country that provides 70%-90% of the world’s Emerald market. Don Victor and his crew were constructing a road to help navigate the mountainous jungle environment on the backside of Columbia. While digging, white and yellow-tipped Quartz points were discovered. He immediately discarded all white crystals and took each and every “Mango Quartz” for himself (his personal collection has still yet to be located). After a short time of following the veins of multicolor Red Quartz underneath the jungle’s surface, he decided to move operations elsewhere and poured slabs of concrete in the entryway of the small mine.","Meaning & Energy":"Mango Quartz is one of the very few minerals in which we are still currently developing an understanding for. We've only recently come in contact with this stone (October 2020) and can already tell how transformative its vibrations are. Its potent energies are a reminder of the true powers of Mother Earth and thankfully Mango Quartz will help one become a benefactor from her tranquil love. These frequencies help adjust one’s mental space to absorb the positives from life's, while being aware and understanding the failures that you went through."},"props":{"Abundance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/abundance","Action":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/action","Adventures":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/adventures","Anxiety

& Origin of Marcasite":"Marcasite is an Iron oxide that has the exact same chemical makeup of Pyrite, but forms in a completely different crystal structure. Unlike Pyrite, Marcasite does not exhibit a cubic identity, instead, it crystallizes in a variety of other forms, such as tabular, pyramidal, nodules, fibers, flakes, and masses. The color of both Iron oxides are extremely similar as well, with Marcasite being lighter in color and incapable of producing that “luster” Pyrite is known for. This mineral has a long history of being misidentified as Pyrite and wasn’t fully given its own classification until 1771 by J. Hill (further defined by W. Haidinger in 1845). Marcasite can commonly be found where there is low-temperature hydrothermal activity (in association with minerals such as Galena, Dolomite, Fluorite, and Calcites), as well next to a secondary mineral (mainly over Chalcopyrite). Marcasite has been found throughout the world, with important deposits located in France, the UK, Brazil, and the United States.","Meaning & Energy":"Marcasite has energies nearly identical to Pyrite, both offering up vibrations of magnitude and endurance while aligning one’s lower chakra system. Through this activation within our belly and groin area, one’s second brain (the gut) passively begins the internal prioritizing of what’s truly important to your soul. The one major difference we notice with Marcasite’s energy as opposed to Pyrite is the Earthly connection one feels during meditation practices. This has pushed our ideology of Marcasite in the direction of a rejuvenation and grounding crystal, as opposed to Pyrite, which is always being classified as the “personal will” and “manifestation stone”.","Balancing The World Around Us":"Both stones assist one with their spiritual journey each day, but Marcasite tends to bring more balance, as well as connect us to the world around us. Marcasite keeps you in the moment and works at a much slower, patient pace, while Pyrite is capable of activating instant soul power and engages your brain rather quickly. Both crystals push one toward achieving happiness and success, but one energy may be more suitable for you than the other."},"props":{"Sexuality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sexuality","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Creativity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creativity","Clarity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clarity","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Courage":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/courage","Cleansing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/cleansing","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Action":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/action","Weight Control":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/weight-control","Bridging the Spiritual and Physical Worlds":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/bridging-the-spiritual-and-physical-worlds","Balancing Polarities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balancing-polarities","Self-Discipline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discipline"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/40/conversions/f795afe311c097b0792fd9d3c5d7adbc-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/40/f795afe311c097b0792fd9d3c5d7adbc.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Midnight%20Lace%20Obsidian.wav","Parent Property":[],"Planets":["Saturn","Earth"],"Zodiacs":["Scorpio","Sagittarius"],"Elements":["Earth"],"Colors":["Black"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Chakras":["Root"],"id":"midnight-lace-obsidian","relURL":"/crystals/midnight-lace-obsidian","name":"Midnight Lace Obsidian","Formula":"SiO2","Hardness":{"min":5,"max":5.5},"Related":[{"Purpurite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/purpurite"},{"Nuummite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/nuummite"},{"Tektite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/tektite"},{"Trolleite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/Trolleite"},{"Maligano Jasper":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/maligano-jasper"},{"Impactite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/impactite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Midnight Lace Obsidian":"Midnight Lace Obsidian is a new mineral that was recently found in the Caucasus Mountains (Armenia). A very small deposit was also found in Oregon (USA) however this deposit was deemed economically insufficient and has no commercial use. This variety is only known to have crystallized in the form of masses, but is highly desired for its unique mixture of transparent and black layers. Crafters and sculptors have been trying to get their hands on this material for cutting and shaping since its discovery. Popular shapes they create are arrowheads, pyramids, obelisks, palm stones, cubes, and hearts.","Meaning & Energy":"Aside from Midnight Lace Obsidian containing all the properties of normal Black Obsidian, it also promotes etheric and psychic protection. During these deep meditation sessions when your consciousness becomes elevated, one must also bear in mind the protection needed when crossing different dimensional planes. As we begin to open ourselves up to higher knowledge and new found energy, we are also exposing ourselves to the unknown. It’s important to have protection talismans with you, especially those that vibrate at such high frequencies. That is exactly what Midnight Lace Obsidian does when one is able to successfully tap into its energies. We recommend carrying it with you daily and becoming more comfortable with every aspect of this stone. Channel it’s energies and constantly cleanse it as it is a heavy energy absorber. Midnight Lace acts as a sponge and soaks up all negativity attempting to attach to your aura. Consider it a shield!"},"props":{"Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Mental Enhancement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mental-enhancement","Motivation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/motivation","Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Self-Discipline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discipline","Living in the Present Moment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/living-in-the-present-moment","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Selflessness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/selflessness","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Alignment with the Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/alignment-with-the-higher-self","Attunement With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement-with-higher-realms","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Channeling and Grounding Higher Vibrations":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/channeling-and-grounding-higher-vibrations","Courage":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/courage","Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Life Path":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/life-path"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/3529/conversions/Mahogany-Obsidian-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/3529/Mahogany-Obsidian.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Mimetite.wav","Parent Property":[],"Planets":["Venus","Earth"],"Zodiacs":["Capricorn"],"Elements":["Fire","Earth"],"Colors":["Yellow","Brass-Yellow","Brown","Gold"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Chakras":["Heart"],"id":"mimetite","relURL":"/crystals/mimetite","name":"Mimetite","Formula":"Pb5(AsO4)3Cl","Hardness":{"min":3.5,"max":4},"Related":[{"Flower Agate":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/flower-agate"},{"Actinolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/actinolite"},{"Watermelon Tourmaline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/watermelon-tourmaline"},{"Cobaltoan Calcite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/cobaltoan-calcite"},{"Wavellite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/wavellite"},{"Pink Tourmaline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pink-tourmaline"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Mimetite":"Mimetite, also known as Mimetesite and Prixite, is a rare lead arsenate chloride mineral that crystallizes in the form of botryoidal, tiny tabular crystals, and small curved acicular crystals. This mineral is a member of the Apatite family and forms from heavy oxidation of lead deposits. Other lead minerals such as Wulfenite, Vanadinite, and Galena can occur near or in association with Mimetite. This crystal was first reported by F.S. Beaudant in 1832 and was named after the Greek word “mimetes” meaning “ imitator”. This name was chosen because of its similar resemblance to Pyromorphite, and them naturally forming near one another. Very fine specimens of Mimetite have come out of Mexico and Namibia, although it can also be found in Australia, Greece, and the USA.","Meaning & Energy ":"Mimetite is a powerful heart stone that is here to provide emotional stability, inner balance, serenity, joy, and adventure. It helps one open up their heart and assist in releasing any and all negative vibrations that may plague our most vital organ. As this crystal aids in removing negative energy, Mimetite also provides nourishing and rejuvenating vibrations to take its place and imbue one’s emotional body and auric field. As the positive energy fills one’s body, it will help in realigning the chakra field and provide overall balance. These actions and energies from Mimetite will provide one with pure joy and bliss. Happiness will soon follow and one will be eager to take on new and exciting hobbies and adventures once more."},"props":{"Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Love & Relationships":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/love-relationships","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Nourishing and Rejuvenation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nourishing-and-rejuvenation","Nuturing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nuturing","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Passion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/passion","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Sexuality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sexuality","Soothing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/soothing","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Clarity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clarity","Compassion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/compassion","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Generosity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/generosity","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/224/conversions/Mimetite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/224/Mimetite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Miriam%20Stone%20(Calligraphy%20Stone).wav","Colors":["Pale Yellow","Yellow","Brown"],"Parent Property":[],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Zodiacs":["Pisces"],"Elements":["Earth"],"Planets":["Earth"],"Chakras":["Root"],"id":"miriam-stone-(calligraphy-stone)","relURL":"/crystals/miriam-stone-(calligraphy-stone)","name":"Miriam Stone (Calligraphy Stone)","Formula":"n{SiO2} p{CaCO3}","Hardness":{"min":6,"max":7},"Related":[{"Chiastolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/chiastolite"},{"Axinite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/axinite"},{"Nundoorite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/nundoorite"},{"Lakelandite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/lakelandite"},{"Limonite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/limonite"},{"Flint":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/flint"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Miriam Stone":"Miriam Stone, also known as Calligraphy Stone, Elephant Skin Jasper, and Arabic Stone, is a unique mineral composed of fossilized shells, bones, and vegetation from an ancient swamp. This complex stone is a result of the Himalayan Mountains shifting and forming the landscape we see today. During this time, the entire area was put under extreme pressure, with conditions ripe enough to fossilize and condense anything surrounding this newly formed mountain chain. This has never occurred anywhere else on planet Earth and makes this newly discovered crystal very appealing on the mineral market. The reason for this is mainly due to Miriam Jasper’s physical appearance and the story of its creation. However, only true practitioners understand the value of the energy that it holds. One will be able to channel the powers of ancient Earth and all of its purity within.","Meaning & Energy":"As one begins to channel this ancient energy throughout their body, a calming and soothing sensation will begin to circulate. This will assist one in “loosening” their physical body and help create a stronger connection to Earth. As one “plugs in”, nurturing and rejuvenation energy will soon fill your auric field. This helps in the overall protection of one’s physical body, as your aura can negate and deflect negative vibrations when strong enough. We chose to nickname Miriam Jasper the “Recharging Stone”, due to its ability to replace one’s “batteries” with simplicity and ease. All it takes is a few minutes out of your day for your mind, body, and spirit to truly reflect the purest form of you. Meditate! Meditate!

Its only known locality is in an area known as the Windalia Radiolarite in Western Australia, which is said to have formed during the Cretaceous Period (145-66 million years ago). This area is full of tiny nanoplankton fossils such as Radiolaria and Foraminifera, both of which played a huge role in the creation process of Mookaite. The colors of this stone are extremely attractive and offer up someone of the brightest yellows and reds we’ve ever come across in a natural mineral. One may also find more uncommon colors in their piece of Mookaite such as beige, brown, grey, and even purple!","Difficult Extraction":"When mining this mineral, one must dig through decomposed Radiolarian clay, which unfortunately is the floor bedding of a small creek. This makes it extremely difficult at times to extract Mookaite, as well as the amount of rock usually lost due to crumbling. This happens because of the diversity and uniqueness of this mineral. Every piece has a different chemical make up, with some containing more Chert than Chalcedony, and vice versa. Pieces with higher Chert content tend to wither, fracture, and crumble with ease. As opposed to the Chalcedony-rich Mookaite, which has a hardness of a 7 and can be cut, polished, and carved.","Meaning & Energy":"Mookaite has energies that enrich one’s trust and love for Mother Earth and all of her beauty. One will find themselves more aware of nature and life around them, as well as developing a connection with the animals we see each day, both wild and domestic. Mookaite grounds your mind, heart, and soul down to a planetary level and helps one truly live in the moment. To do this, one must relinquish any and all ideas that do not deal with the “right now”. These future emotions that we’re subconsciously manifesting take their toll on our bodies day in and day out. Fear, anxiety, loneliness, and depression are all common symptoms of failing to live in the present moment. Mookaite’s bold and bright natural colors are a reminder that beauty is all around you, including within. Use the energies and the lessons this stone offers (through deep meditation), and one will soon learn how to “stop and smell the roses”. This mentality will not only save your emotional body, but also give you the chance to grow each day, no matter the circumstances.","Gateway Crystals":"Mookaite is also a fantastic secondary crystal to aid in the opening of your solar plexus chakra. This gateway houses one of our most desirable traits as human beings, our own personal will and determination. When one has access (and control) over this part of their bodies, there is no limitation on what can be achieved in this world. Meditate with Mookaite in conjunction with primary solar plexus crystals such as Orange Calcite, Mahogany Obsidian, Citrine, Tiger Eye, Imperial Topaz, and Brucite."},"props":{"Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Power":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/power","Physical

Its name was derived by A.G. Werner in 1780 due to the shimmering effect that occurs on the stone’s surface during light diffraction. This has made Moonstone extremely valuable in the jewelry world thus resulting in high prices. There are quite a few Moonstone localities in the world, although the highest quality material (adorned by jewelers) is usually from Sri Lanka, India, Brazil, Myanmar, Australia, and Madagascar.","Meaning & Energy":"Moonstone is a stone of self-discovery at the highest of levels. Infuse your body with the essence of Mother Earth and become more in touch with your inner spirit than you ever have before. Allow Moonstone’s energy to truly engage your intuitive spirit and pave the way for growth, opportunity, and action. Release yourself from the daily pressures you place on yourself and take the time you truly deserve. Our upper chakras become engaged when working with this stone and it helps one in the developmental process of pushing further into your consciousness.","Deep Meditation Sessions":"Moonstone is capable of connecting one’s spirit to the higher echelons of the universe. Within these diverse realms are the answers to everything we’ve ever wondered in our life. These answers will give you all the knowledge you need for eternal enlightenment. We recommend working with Moonstone as much as possible, especially in raw form! Try placing a piece directly over your third eye during a deep meditation session and strap in for a truly magical experience.","Crystal Pairings":"Try pairing Moonstone with other high vibration stones to truly help you ascend! One of our favorite stones to combine with Moonstone is Cavansite. The incredible dream capabilities of this crystal invoke an instant connection to outer dimensions, especially when one’s consciousness is able to fully relax. A few other stones that offer similar powers, just not as potent are Blue Kyanite, Iolite, Shattuckite, Tanzanite, and Azurite ."},"props":{"Nourishing and Rejuvenation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nourishing-and-rejuvenation","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Dreams":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dreams","Love & Relationships":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/love-relationships","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Empathy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/empathy","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Generosity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/generosity","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Creativity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creativity","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Fertility and Pregnancy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/fertility-and-pregnancy"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/7763/conversions/Moonstone-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/7763/Moonstone.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Mordenite.wav","Parent Property":[],"Chakras":["Heart"],"Elements":["Wind","Earth"],"Planets":["Earth"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Colors":["White","Orange","Pink","Yellow","Red","Colorless"],"Zodiacs":["Capricorn"],"id":"mordenite","relURL":"/crystals/mordenite","name":"Mordenite","Formula":"(Na2, Ca, K2)4(Al8Si40)O96•28H2O","Hardness":{"min":5,"max":5},"Related":[{"Fuchsite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/fuchsite"},{"Mangano Calcite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/mangano-calcite"},{"Tree Agate":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/tree-agate"},{"Pink Calcite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pink-calcite"},{"Tugtupite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/tugtupite"},{"Watermelon Tourmaline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/watermelon-tourmaline"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Mordenite":"Mordenite is a hydrated sodium, calcium, and potassium aluminosilicate mineral and member of the Zeolite family. It crystallizes in the form of masses, striated needle-like points, fibrous aggregates, and small prismatic shards. The most common colors Mordenite is found in is chalky-white and a salmon orange-pink (other lesser-known varieties include yellow, red, and even colorless). This mineral is one of the most common in the entire Zeolite family, even though it was only discovered back in 1864 by Henry How (Apophyllite, a similar Zeolite mineral, was discovered nearly 60 years prior; all the way back in 1806). He chose to name it after the type locality (place of discovery), a small town known as Morden in Nova Scotia, Canada. Since then, Mordenite has been discovered in Russia, India, Iceland, Italy, Scotland, and the USA. A majority of specimens have other Zeolite minerals intergrown, most notably Stibnite, Heulandite, and even Scolecite.","Meaning & Energy":"Mordenite is a tremendously strong stone that resonates with one’s heart and entire emotional body. Its energies are very similar to Pink Opal, and offers soothing vibrations that can calm one’s entire aura. These frequencies are very subtle and extremely potent; helping one passively spread positive affirmations at a subconscious level. This assists in not only the path towards the betterment of yourself but also the ones around you. Your newly found love and compassionate energies will soon naturally spread like wildfire to those closest to you. This love will not only strengthen your family and friends individually but also the connection and the relationship they have with you.","Stone Pairing":"Try meditating with this stone in conjunction with Rose Quartz, Rhodochrosite, Kunzite, Thulite, and/or Cobaltoan Calcite. All these stones strongly resonate with your emotional body and can not only assist Mordenite’s energies but also elevate them as well. For added purification of one’s aura, throw your favorite piece of Jet into the mix!"},"props":{"Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Living in the Present Moment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/living-in-the-present-moment","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Nourishing and Rejuvenation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nourishing-and-rejuvenation","New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Nuturing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nuturing","Passion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/passion","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Physical Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/physical-healing","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","PTSD":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ptsd","Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Selflessness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/selflessness","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Soothing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/soothing","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Trauma":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trauma","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Clairvoyance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clairvoyance","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Breaking Addictions":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/breaking-addictions","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Claiming Wholeness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/claiming-wholeness","Clarity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clarity","Compassion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/compassion","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Empathy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/empathy","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Grief and Mourning":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grief-and-mourning","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/4973/conversions/Mordenite-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/4974/conversions/Mordenite-Single-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/4973/Mordenite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Morganite.wav","Parent Property":[],"Planets":["Venus"],"Zodiacs":["Libra"],"Elements":["Water"],"Colors":["Pink"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Chakras":["Heart"],"id":"morganite","relURL":"/crystals/morganite","name":"Morganite","Formula":"Be3Al2(Si6O18)","Hardness":{"min":7.5,"max":8},"Related":[{"Fuchsite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/fuchsite"},{"Mordenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/mordenite"},{"Watermelon Tourmaline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/watermelon-tourmaline"},{"Wavellite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/wavellite"},{"Pink Tourmaline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pink-tourmaline"},{"Actinolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/actinolite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Morganite":"Morganite is the peach or light pink color variety of Beryl.

Deposits of this stone have been found in Brazil, China, Australia, France, and the United States.","Meaning & Energy":"Morganite is one of the strongest heart stones that you can get your hands on.

This stone is here to help open up and cleanse one’s heart space from constant negative weight. We must face the negative energy and move on from it. The role of Morganite is to help one garner the courage and confidence to face these feelings. Simply being reminded of our heart’s power can help one realize the potential to love again. We highly recommend this stone to anyone who has gone through some sort of trauma. Whether you’ve lost someone very close to you or are simply going through a rough break up, Morganite will become your best friend. Just holding this stone in times of distress will remind you of the inner strength that your heart possess.","Pairing With High Frequency Stones":"To increase the strength of Morganite’s energies during deep meditation sessions, we recommend adding other heart or high frequency stones. Some heart stones such as Rose Quartz, Green Calcite, and Pink Opal will make it easier to access and unlock one's heart. Each of these stones, especially Green Calcite will help in the cleansing and clearing of negative energy in one’s heartspace. Higher frequency stones that will help enhance and strengthen Morganite’s energy are Quartz, Selenite, and Phenacite. Each one of these stones will push the powerful rays of Morganite into action while also healing any and all emotional wounds."},"props":{"Selflessness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/selflessness","Nourishing and Rejuvenation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nourishing-and-rejuvenation","Nuturing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nuturing","Passion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/passion","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Physical Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/physical-healing","Purification":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/purification","Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Soothing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/soothing","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Trauma":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trauma","Travel":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/travel","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Claiming Wholeness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/claiming-wholeness","Compassion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/compassion","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Grief and Mourning":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grief-and-mourning","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Love & Relationships":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/love-relationships","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/228/conversions/Morganite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/228/Morganite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Moss%20Agate.wav","Parent Property":[],"Colors":["Yellow","Brown","Red","Black","Green"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Zodiacs":["Virgo"],"Elements":["Earth"],"Planets":["Earth"],"Chakras":["Root","Heart"],"id":"moss-agate","relURL":"/crystals/moss-agate","name":"Moss Agate","Formula":"SiO2","Hardness":{"min":7,"max":7},"Related":[{"Brochantite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/brochantite"},{"Rhyolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/rhyolite"},{"Orthoclase":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/orthoclase"},{"Zebra Calcite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/zebra-calcite"},{"Mangano Calcite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/mangano-calcite"},{"Nundoorite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/nundoorite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Moss Agate":"Moss Agate (also known as Mocha Stone) unlike its name, is not actually an Agate at all, rather it is a Chalcedony with dendritic inclusions of Manganese, Chrome, and/or Iron. The impurities within resemble moss and other various patterns, leading one to believe true organic matter is encased inside. However, that is not true at all, as Moss Agate formed from the weathering of strong volcanic rock. The deep colors and vibrant patterns are simply due to different levels of oxidation of the crystals within. These colors are most notably green or brown, but can also be seen as yellow, red, and black. Moss Agate has localities all over the world, with the most important commercialized deposits being in India. In fact, around 75% of all Moss Agate on the market is directly sourced from India.","Watch Out For Fakes!":"*Moss Agate is commonly faked and/or dyed and sold as lower quality Agate. Most of it gets heat treated and coated in similar color patterns. This is due to the ease at which Moss Agate sells. Not only is there the historical name attached to it (Mocha Stone, named after the famed ancient deposit of this mineral in Mocha, Yemen), but also the vibrant colors normally not found in an “Agate” (Chalcedony).*","Meaning & Energy":"Moss Agate brings us closer to Mother Earth, with energies capable of helping us ground and pursue our most benevolent ideas. This crystal offers up shells of protection around your aura and truly lets you be you. Moss Agate encourages self expression and a rebuilding of divine connection to nature that most of our childhoods were consumed with. Pure happiness and joy is all around us; through life, animals, food, and art. Moss Agate provides one with a new desire to find comfort in smaller, more human things; as opposed to unnatural desires society presents to us. One is encouraged to go back to their “roots'' when meditating with this stone, and allow that inner, carefree child to shine through. There is love within you just waiting to be released and what better way to release this energy then with the simplest things life has to offer. The less stress in your life, the more you will enjoy your time here. That is something Moss Agate’s energies are sure to remind us about, as we all so blissfully forget that golden rule."},"props":{"New

member of the Mica family. It crystallizes in the form of small hexagonal or tabular “crisps”, as well as elongated sheets and solid masses. Muscovite is mainly found in a grey to silverish-brown color, but can also be seen as white, green, yellow, red, colorless, and most recently blue.The blue variety was found in 2004 by a group of miners in Yilgarn, Western Australia. It's the only time this color of Mica has ever been found and is frequently referred to as “Australian Lapis”. The majority of commercial grade Muscovite deposits come out of Brazil, but they can also be found in Italy, Afghanistan, India, Russia, and the United States.","Meaning & Energy":"Muscovite is a high vibrational mineral that has similar energies to that of Barite. Your mental capacity will become more clear and even expand when working with this crystal. This is in addition to the activation of many unique psychic abilities. One’s brain waves will be able to ascend and attune to the “energies of the gods” and reach higher dimensions with endless knowledge of yourself and the universe. This plane is where our guardian angels and spiritual advisors reside, studying our decision making in this multidimensional realm. One is able to communicate with these deities through deep meditation, as well as tapping into and channeling the energies of certain powerful stones. Placing Muscovite over your third eye during meditation experiences will help one break through the “physical barrier” that prevents our minds from easily eluding our bodies. Doing this repeatedly will help one train their pineal gland and expand the powers it holds. This will greatly help anyone experimenting with astral projection and lucid dreaming, as it works to strengthen our outward connection to the unknown. We recommend this mineral to any and all levels of practitioners. It will greatly benefit the connection to your true self, without the energies being too much for some to handle."},"props":{"Inner

& Origin of Nevada Rose":"Nevada Rose, also known as Pink/Purple Dumortierite is an extremely rare mineral that has been found in only one locality of Northern Nevada. This stone was first reported in 1959 by John Sinkankas in the book “Gemstones of North America”. He chose to name this stone after the state in which it was found and the color of the few specimens he had discovered. The color is altered at a chemical level due to tiny inclusions of Titanium.","Meaning & Energy":"Pairing this crystal with other heart chakra stones will help amplify its healing effects. One of our personal favorites is Kunzite (if you can get your hands on a piece). The energies from this pink variety of Spodumene combined with Nevada Rose is capable of removing the current blockages that we wake up with every day. Through deep meditation and allowing your mind to work with a clean slate, one will relinquish their need for control and enter a free-flowing state.","Crystal Pairing":"If you find yourself facing traumatic or PTSD-like mental scenarios, use Rhodochrosite with Pink Dumortierite to place your ego to the side. Looking inwardly through self-reflection is a trait we often lack to exercise each day. These two crystals will provide you the opportunity to purge both the pain and self-doubt that you carry. Your inner strength will shine when you begin to let yourself live, breathe, and love again."},"props":{"Calming and

This mineral is unlike any other stone in the world and can only be found in the famous Shungite deposits of Karelia, Russia. All Shungite is carbon-based and contains the naturally occurring molecules called “fullerenes”, which have been confirmed to contain antibacterial microbes. These molecules have been used for hundreds of years to purify water, as well as having been used for royalty in the form of modern “spa treatments”. Noble Shungite is highly recommended for elixir rather than the classic black Shungite ore. Black Shungite tends to have flakes that shed and only contains around 30% carbon, whereas Elite Shungite contains around 98%+ carbon. It is the only known allotropic form of naturally occurring Carbon in the world.","Meaning & Energy":"Noble Shungite shares the same energies and properties of classic Shungite, but is more potent and (in our opinion) faster acting. One can feel the purifying effects immediately upon touch, which will drastically alter your attitude and energy levels. It is also one of the most powerful protection stones we know of. It has the ability to ward off any evil entity or vibration one may come in contact with (or through exposure during deep meditation)."},"props":{"Nourishing and Rejuvenation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nourishing-and-rejuvenation","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Self-Discipline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discipline","Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Purification":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/purification","PTSD":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ptsd","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Motivation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/motivation","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Mastering Fear":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mastering-fear","Longevity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/longevity","Living in the Present Moment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/living-in-the-present-moment","Leadership":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/leadership","Grounding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grounding","Selflessness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/selflessness","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Soothing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/soothing","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Trauma":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trauma","Travel":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/travel","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Breaking Addictions":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/breaking-addictions","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Chakra Cleansing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/chakra-cleansing","Clarity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clarity","Confidence":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/confidence","Consciousness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/consciousness","Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality","Dispelling Negative Energy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dispelling-negative-energy","Elimination Toxins":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/elimination-toxins","EMF":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emf","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Expansion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expansion"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/4736/conversions/Noble-Shungite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/4736/Noble-Shungite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Nundoorite.wav","Colors":["Olive Green ","Green","Brown"],"Parent Property":[],"Zodiacs":["Pisces","Libra","Leo"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Elements":["Earth"],"Planets":["Earth"],"Chakras":["Root","Heart"],"id":"nundoorite","relURL":"/crystals/nundoorite","name":"Nundoorite","Formula":"n{NaFe3+Si2O6} p{KAlSi3O8}","Hardness":{"min":6.5,"max":6.5},"Related":[{"Chiastolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/chiastolite"},{"Axinite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/axinite"},{"Moss Agate":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/moss-agate"},{"Brochantite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/brochantite"},{"Pargasite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pargasite"},{"Peanut Obsidian":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/peanut-obsidian"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Nundoorite":"Nundoorite, also known as Nunderite, is an extremely rare mineral formed by the combination of Aegirine (Green) and Orthoclase (Brown). It crystallizes in the form of masses, with a unique spotted pattern of Aegirine displayed throughout. This mineral was discovered in the early 1960s in Nundora, New South Wales, Australia. The deposit was unusually small and mined to extinction within just a few years. This was partially due to the popularity it received amongst Australian lapidary artists during that time. Since then, there have been multiple rumored reports of another vein of Nundoorite discovered in New Zealand. We have not been able to independently confirm this, but if true, it would be a game-changer for the mineral community!","Meaning & Energy":"Nundoorite forges a superior bond between the heart and root chakra systems, promoting an extension of Earth’s energies to be channeled within. This abundant wave of restorative energy is imbued within us and assists one in all forms of self-healing, especially the emotional body. Our home planet provides the proper ingredients to help one maintain their own personal joy Nundoorite is simply an amulet, or small bridge, that helps one find their way home to heal and harness love, light, and happiness.","Revealing Areas of Growth":"A common practice we recommend any level practitioner to take part in is the “whispering of trauma” you’ve experienced into this stone. Nundoorite does more than just hold secrets, as your heart and root are connected throughout your sessions and beyond. As you expel your deepest pains and allow for them to be spoken into the physical realm, a sense of fatigue may rush over you. This is known as an emotional flush and is a positive sign! You are giving your heart SO much love while allowing it to speak about the damage it's carrying. Take your time during these brief sessions (5-15 minutes) and push yourself to be uncomfortable (don’t forget to cleanse your crystal after each session). Doing this repeatedly will allow for your true character to shine through; a powerful and potent human being capable of anything you desire."},"props":{"Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Peace of

& Origin of Nuummite":"Nuummite, also known as Nuummit, is a very rare metamorphic rock that also happens to be the oldest mineral ever discovered, estimated to be around 3 billion years old. This unique crystal is made up of 2 relatively unknown minerals, Anthophyllite and Gertie. The first being a magnesium iron silicate, while the latter is in the family of lithium bearing amphiboles. Nuummite crystallizes in the form of laminates and masses, with a heavy majority of this mineral coming out of Greenland. Due to the extreme harsh weather of this country, this mineral is only capable of being mined a few months out of the year when the ground is not frozen. This mineral was first discovered by K. L. Giesecke in 1810 and was named after the area in Greenland in which it was found, Nuuk. Since his discovery over 200 years ago, only a tiny amount of Nuummite has been discovered in other places around the world. These extremely scarce localities include the Yukon River in Canada, Converse County, Wyoming, as well as Kainuu, Finland. This mineral is most commonly black, but can be found as a very dark brown. Often times there is iridescent spectral color within Nuummite that can show a variety of gold, blue, copper, purple, silver, green,and violet color spectrums through out. ","Meaning & Energy":"Nuummite works towards bridging the spiritual and physical realms together, providing a channel for higher knowledge and transformative energy to grow and prosper. This stone helps unlock one’s third eye and activate your own unique psychic abilities. Inner vision of one's past lives, as well as messages from your guardian angels and spirit guides coming through to you during dreams or intense meditation sessions are fairly common when initially working with Nuummite. Try placing this stone over your third eye and allow the stones energy to directly be absorbed into your pineal gland. Pulsating vibrations will soon begin to imbue your entire body and elevate one’s entire consciousness. This mineral holds the key to many of Earth’s secrets, as well as the life that once existed on this planet. Working with this stone repeatedly and becoming more comfortable with the energy it holds is a huge part in understanding the mystery behind Nuummite. ","Crystal Pairings":"We urge you to meditate with Nuummite and Moldavite together and allow this combined transformative energy to take over your entire mind and body. These powerful minerals together will help clear ones heart space and emotional body of old trauma and lingering emotions one can't seem to move forward from. The purifying energies of Nuummite help keep ones heart clear while being able to slowly heal itself and become stronger than ever before. One will begin a transformative journey that will push you forward into an exciting new life full of endless opportunity, love, and happiness. "},"props":{"Psychic

It crystallizes in the form of tiny blade like crystals that resemble a cotton ball. This mineral looks as if it's covered in hair or fuzz, and can even resemble that when felt. Okenite’s crystal structure allows them to be bendable and move unlike any other crystal you may have seen before! Be careful not to bend each crystal too much, as it's still a very fragile mineral. Okenite was discovered by F. Von Kobell in 1828, and was named after the famed German Botanist, Lorenz Oken. Okenite is usually found in a pale to pearly white color, but can also be seen as yellow and very light blue. The most famous locality of Okenite is in the state of Maharashtra, India. It can also be found in Iceland, Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Chile, New Zealand, Ireland, and the USA. Most of these locations see Okenite forming near or in association with a variety of Zeolites, Apophyllite, or Prehnite .","Meaning & Energy":"Okenite activates and unlocks our crown chakra, helping us process and understand knowledge from higher realms and dimensions. This stone provides mental clarity to anyone who works with it, and will help use that clarity in the dream realm and during deep meditative sessions. Although it's not necessarily a “dream stone”, Okenite can help one better understand the images we see within this realm and how it affects what we do here on Earth. Okenite helps one bridge the physical and spiritual worlds together, providing one with powerful high energy that can be used on this physical plane.This unique mineral is very powerful and brings in the energies and vibrations from higher dimensions and realms. Okenite is also a manifestation stone that can help one achieve their most sought after dreams and desires. It provides growth, life force energy, and vitality to anyone who attaches themselves to this stone. We suggest first setting your intentions into a piece of Okenite, then meditating with it immediately afterwards. Allow the stones energy to imbue your entire body and grant you extreme clarity of the mind. This new found mental space can be used to plan out step by step how one will achieve their dreams. No more “foggy” minds!","Crystal Pairings":"Okenite may be too strong by itself for beginning practitioners and should be used in association with very strong grounding stones. These “Earthy” stones will provide one with an unbreakable connection to their home planet, and will help soften Okenite’s otherworldly energies. We recommend Black Tourmaline, , Obsidian (Black), or Galena."},"props":{"Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Energy Transfer":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/energy-transfer","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Expansion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expansion","Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/higher-self","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Intention Enhancement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intention-enhancement","Dreams":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dreams","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Lucid Dreaming":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/lucid-dreaming","Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Astral Travel":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/astral-travel","Alignment with the Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/alignment-with-the-higher-self","Angelic Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/angelic-communication","Ascension":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ascension","Attunement With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement-with-higher-realms","Attunement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement","Bridging the Spiritual and Physical Worlds":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/bridging-the-spiritual-and-physical-worlds","Channeling and Grounding Higher Vibrations":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/channeling-and-grounding-higher-vibrations","Clarity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clarity","Communication With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-higher-realms","Communication with Guides":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-guides","Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/226/conversions/Okenite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/226/Okenite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://cdn.reamaze.com/audio/snapup.mp3","Planets":["Earth","Mars","Saturn"],"Chakras":["Third Eye","Solar Plexus","Root"],"Zodiacs":["Leo"],"Colors":["Black"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Elements":["Earth"],"id":"onyx-","relURL":"/crystals/onyx-","name":"Onyx ","Formula":"SiO2","Hardness":{"min":7,"max":7},"Related":[{"Red Jasper":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/red-jasper"},{"Black Tourmaline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/black-tourmaline"},{"Fluorite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/fluorite"},{"Ruby Zoisite (Anyolite)":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/ruby-zoisite-anyolite"},{"Green Opal":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/green-opal"},{"Rainbow Obsidian":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/rainbow-obsidian"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Onyx":"Onyx is a type of Chalcedony that occurs naturally with tiny banded parallel layers. The mineral was first reported in 77 A.D. by Gaius Plinius Secundus (Pliny the Elder) and named after the Greek word “claw” or “fingernail” because of its similar resemblance. The name got its use because of the shape and brightness of the bands Onyx shows when sliced. A variety of colors are commonly found throughout various countries of the world. These countries include Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Australia, South Africa, Madagascar, India, and the United States.","Ancient Uses":"Onyx has been used for thousands of years and has a long history with many different civilizations. The Ancient Egyptians used","Beware of Fakes!":"The most common colors of Onyx are black, brown, white, red, and orange. Black is the most popular color on the market, which sometimes results in impure varieties of Chalcedony to be dyed black. This has driven the price of Onyx very low because of how flooded the market has become with manipulated versions. We recommend buying from a trusted and reliable dealer because you never know what you could be purchasing.","Meaning & Energy":"Onyx is a stone that offers up powerful vibrations of protection, strength, focus, and willpower. This stone is here to continuously push you forward in your life. By activating your root, solar plexus, and third eye chakras, one is able to fully ground themselves to Earth. Not only will Onyx give you a jolt of energy to get up and start pursuing your dreams, but also protect you on your new journey. Simply carrying this stone or wearing Onyx daily will provide a shield around ones aura, refusing to allow negative energy to attach itself to you. This stone has been used as protection for thousands of years and is still one of the strongest protection stones we know of.","Crystal Pairings":"When meditating with this stone we recommend placing a piece on your third eye or simply in front of you. When looking to active one’s psychic abilities, Onyx can assist in opening a channel to higher realms containing endless knowledge. Meditating with a high vibration crystal like Quartz or Selenite can help establish a stronger “deep state” connection when in meditation. When one is looking to root ideas and goals down to Earth, we suggest placing a piece of Onyx in front of you to channel your dreams and desires. Construct exactly what it is you wish to have in this world, and continuously remind yourself that you will find your way."},"props":{"Retrograde":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/retrograde","Decisiveness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/decisiveness","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Confidence":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/confidence","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Clearing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clearing","Purification":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/purification","Cleansing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/cleansing","Self-Discipline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discipline","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Focus":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/focus","Attraction":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attraction","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Balancing Polarities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balancing-polarities","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Grief and Mourning":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grief-and-mourning"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/86/conversions/4e5472707dca0e1a90ee0cb72c031a05-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/86/4e5472707dca0e1a90ee0cb72c031a05.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Orange%20Aventurine.wav","Elements":["Earth","Fire"],"Planets":["Earth","Venus"],"Parent Property":[],"Colors":["Orange"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Zodiacs":["Aries","Virgo"],"Chakras":["Root","Solar Plexus"],"id":"orange-aventurine","relURL":"/crystals/orange-aventurine","name":"Orange Aventurine","Formula":"SiO2","Hardness":{"min":6,"max":7},"Related":[{"Rhyolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/rhyolite"},{"Peanut Obsidian":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/peanut-obsidian"},{"Mookaite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/mookaite"},{"Orthoclase":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/orthoclase"},{"Zebra Calcite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/zebra-calcite"},{"Peach Moonstone":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/peach-moonstone"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Orange Aventurine":"Orange Aventurine is a member of the Aventurine family and a variety of Quartz.

It crystallizes in the form of masses, large tabular rods (with striations), and bladed clusters. The color is from impurities of Hematite within, with the darker orange pieces containing larger amounts of this iron-bearing stone. Larger quantities of this mineral are found in Mexico and as of recently Morocco. This has led to a massive reduction in value as well as an overflow on the market. Even though Selenite is extremely fragile, you can find this mineral cut and crafted in many different forms at your local gem shop or mineral show.","Meaning & Energy":"Orange Selenite and the energies it carries are nearly identical to normal Selenite, with the only difference being the heavy grounding effect Hematite offers. Normal white or clear Selenite is extremely powerful and offers potent energies capable of initiating a spiritual awakening. As Selenite would normally ascend your mind and consciousness, Orange Selenite grounds both your physical and spiritual body, while still engaging in the enlightenment of the soul.

sulfide mineral that crystallizes in the form of masses, botryoidal, and small prismatic shards (extremely rare). Its color is bright yellow to pale yellow, and forms from the decay of a mineral called Realgar, near volcanic steam holes or natural hot springs. This mineral has been used for centuries, but was officially recorded as its own mineral in 1771 by J. Hill. He named it after the Latin word “auripigmentum”, meaning “gold paint,'' referring to its main use during that time period. Orpiment can be found all over the world, with the most important deposits located in Hunan Province, China, as well as the El'brusskiy mine in Mt. Elbrus, Russia. Other countries with important localities include Peru, Iran, Macedonia, Argentina, France, Germany, Italy and the United States.","Toxicity Of Orpiment":"One should be extremely cautious when handling or working with Orpiment. This mineral can leave toxic traces of arsenic on your hand if not washed, which can be poisonous if ingested or rubbed into the eyes. Additionally, avoid placing it in your pockets as traces can attach to your clothes. We highly urge you to meditate with Orpiment, just be extremely safe about it. As soon as you finish your meditation session, head over to the sink and immediately wash your hands. This way one can remove any trace of arsenic that may have rubbed off of the mineral. Also, be wary of the hardness of Orpiment because it is very brittle.","Meaning & Energy":"Orpiment resonates with one's solar plexus chakra, specifically one’s personal will. Your “will” will become activated and aligned with your emotional body. This will help you become more in touch with your personal desires. Your energy level will increase when using this stone, as well as your focus, strength, and confidence. One will notice themselves having a different perception of the things and people closest to them, resulting in a possible change of environment. Now that one is fully aligned and focused on their dreams, any baggage they carry that does not serve them will soon be replaced. This is not only healthy for someone with high aspirations, but also extremely challenging for anyone to do. Orpiment makes this process much less stressful and emotionally taxing by being a constant reminder of what’s most important to you."},"props":{"Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Leadership":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/leadership","Life Path":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/life-path","Living in the Present Moment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/living-in-the-present-moment","Longevity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/longevity","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Luck and Good Fortune":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/luck-and-good-fortune","Mastering Fear":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mastering-fear","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Mental Enhancement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mental-enhancement","Motivation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/motivation","New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Personal Will":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/personal-will","Power":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/power","Prosperity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/prosperity","Self-Discipline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discipline","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Courage":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/courage","Abundance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/abundance","Action":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/action","Adventures":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/adventures","Breaking Addictions":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/breaking-addictions","Confidence":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/confidence","Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality","Creativity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creativity","Decisiveness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/decisiveness","Determination":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/determination","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Expansion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expansion","Focus":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/focus","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/387/conversions/orpiment-5-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/387/orpiment-5.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Orthoceras.wav","Parent Property":[],"Colors":["Silver","Grey","Black"],"Chakras":["Root"],"Elements":["Earth"],"Planets":["Earth"],"id":"orthoceras","relURL":"/crystals/orthoceras","name":"Orthoceras","Formula":"CaCO3","Hardness":{"min":3.5,"max":4},"Related":[{"Kambaba Jasper":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/kambaba-jasper"},{"Botswana Agate":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/botswana-agate"},{"Truffle Chalcedony":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/truffle-chalcedony"},{"Goethite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/goethite"},{"Septarian":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/septarian"},{"Desert Rose Selenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/desert-rose-selenite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Orthoceras":"Orthoceras, also known as Orthoceratites, is a genus of extinct nautiloid cephalopod.

They are the ancient ancestors of ammonites and squid that can be found in sizes ranging from a centimeter to over 14 feet long. Orthoceras are commonly found on a rock matrix,most of the time being limestone. A majority of specimens on the market have been coming out of Morocco, Scandinavia, Sweden, and the Baltic states.","Meaning & Energy":"When it comes to the energy in which this fossil possess, it's all about the ancient knowledge this sea creature holds.

It can form on most granites and pegmatites, as well as being one of the main chemical components of Moonstone. The most common colors of Orthoclase are usually a beige-grey or light brown, but can also be found in white, pink, and various shades of red. This mineral was first discovered in 1801 by R.J. Hauy. It was named after the Greek word meaning “straight fracture”, referencing it’s double cleavage planes being at right angles to one another. Orthoclase can be found all over the world, with the most important commercial deposits located in Russia, Tanzania, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Madagascar, and the United States. The largest Orthoclase crystal ever discovered is over 30 feet in length and weighs over 100 tons. This truly remarkable find was in the Ural mountains, where it was found formed off an extremely large pegmatite.","Other-Worldly":"Orthoclase is one of the very few minerals that we know has existed beyond our own planet! Samples of the moon surface were brought back during the American astronauts Apollo missions. Upon further analysis, small traces of Orthoclase were found on the lunar sand. A more recent discovery of this mineral was when NASA’s rover touched down on Mars. It immediately began capturing any and all details it could. One of the more unusual discoveries that was not discussed was the high amount of Orthoclase in some parts of the Martian surface. This was a huge red flag for geologists, because some believe that this directly correlates to massive volatility on the red planet’s surface. Much more evidence needs to be found however this is vital for understanding Mars’s history and exactly what has transpired on our planetary neighbor.","Meaning & Energy":"Orthoclase offers up vital enhancing energies for anyone looking to transform their lives and find love, happiness, and joy within. The vibrations coming off this stone help ground you down to this physical plane while helping you truly understand your Earthly emotions. As one becomes more connected with themselves, they may begin to have completely different thoughts. This is the process of Orthoclase relinquishing the minuscule stressors that we carry and imbuing one with a sense of clarity and life force energy. These are vital aspects to one’s personal growth and will help develop the pure lifestyle our soul is chasing.","Negativity Blocker":"Orthoclase also protects and blocks one’s auric field from any negative energies. Imagine the roots and vibrations of Mother Earth encasing you and driving away any frequencies that are here to hurt. However, do not think that bad times are not beneficial for you. This is a common misconception that Orthoclase is here to prove false. These “dark” times that we experience (and are forced to live through) offer up some of the most explosive, growth-induced energy. Channel these vibrations towards the most important things and watch as the beginning stages of eternal happiness slowly develop within."},"props":{"Luck and Good

& Origin of Pargasite":"Pargasite is a magnesium calcium iron aluminium sodium mineral and member of the Amphibole family (closely related to Hornblende; a complex dark Amphibole mineral). It crystallizes in the form of shards and compact granular crystals. Most often, these gems are found embedded in an extremely hard matrix such as Granite. The color of Pargasite is most commonly a vibrant green, but can also be found as brown, light yellow, and black. This mineral was first discovered in 1814 by Count Fabian Gotthard von Steinheil. He chose to name it after the town in which it was discovered (as well as the town he governed), Pargas, Finland. Since it’s initial finding, small amounts of Pargasite have been extracted in Vietnam, Sweden, Canada, Russia, Scotland, Austria, Venezuela, and the United States.","Meaning & Energy":"Pargasite is a healer of the heart and mender of emotional pain. These energies extract the negative vibrations that have attached themselves to your emotional body, which up until now, may have left you unable to push past them. Meditating in the presence of this stone provides one with the necessary nutrients to “break through” and simply begin again. By that, I mean the basic ability to move forward from inner trauma and allow love and light back into your life. With joy and enlightenment in your mind, one is able to consciously evaluate aspects of your life you may not have seen before. This may lead to the shedding of current hobbies, relationships, and in some cases, occupations.","Stone Pairings":"We recommend the addition of other stones that resonate deep within the heart to increase the strength of your healing. Some stones we suggest to use in conjunction with Pargasite include Jade, Rose Quartz, Eudialyte, Rhodochrosite, Kunzite, and Malachite. These minerals protect, replenish, and expand our entire emotional body, allowing energy to flow freely. This rejuvenating effect will be unlike anything you have felt before, with your true identity coming through. Continue this meditation practice as much as possible while pushing yourself to not only love who you are, but others as well."},"props":{"Calming and

& Origin of Peach Moonstone":"Peach Moonstone is a variety of Moonstone. It is a potassium aluminum silicate feldspar. The color is usually a tan brown to a very light peach/pink (these colors are able to be seen easier in direct sunlight). This change in color is believed to be caused from higher contents of aluminum within the feldspar’s chemical make-up. Vast quantities of Peach Moonstone have been recently coming out of Madagascar, with a majority of the material being sculpted by local artisan craftsmen and women. Expect to see a lot of palm stones, shapes, obelisks. and more at your local shop or Gem show!","Meaning & Energy":"Peach Moonstone shares the same divine feminine energies as other Moonstone varieties, but offers an extra special connection between your heart and personal will (solar plexus). One will also continue to share the same protective qualities of Moonstone as you work to explore your creative and loving energies (and how you might be able to improve them). Peach Moonstone is a more inward-loving mineral and helps reignite your passion for the things that make you happy in this world. As one’s mind is continuously cluttered with nonsense and emotion-induced thinking, our true character gets left behind. Over time, we lose this ever strong connection we have with our inner spirits, as well as the interest that drives these feelings. As self-loving vibrations pour out of this stone every time you work with it, we want you to get in the rhythm of doing something positive for yourself. Reward yourself with a hobby you once loved or treat yourself to a place you once frequented. Try something entirely new that has been on your mind for days or even months now. These are all small things that reinforce the love you truly have for yourself. As you begin to grow more comfortable with yourself, only then can you begin to truly love the ones around you."},"props":{"Motivation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/motivation","Power":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/power","Physical

& Origin of Peanut Obsidian":"Peanut Obsidian is a variety of Perlite and a naturally occurring amorphous volcanic glass with high water content. The red spheres which make this crystal so unique are actually feldspar crystals. These have been stained red over time by a coating of Hematite. It was discovered in Alamos, Sonora, Mexico by Alberto Maas. The name of this new material was supposed to be “Almasite”, but upon further investigation, that name was already claimed for another mineral. Interestingly, no other deposit of this mineral has been discovered. Much of the available inventory on the market is being hoarded by American and Mexican jewelers.","Meaning & Energy":"Peanut Obsidian offers up mysterious energies, some of which can help one better connect to Mother Earth. The grounding vibrations help root one down to this physical realm, while also allowing their consciousness to expand and grow. The feldspar and Hematite within this mineral help activate one’s creative thinking, as well as engage your personal will. We recommend trying this stone during your next meditation session while placing it over your belly. This will help increase the relationship between your lower three chakras, while enhancing their energies. This trifecta develops a channel that will allow one to easily express themselves thus allowing their second brain (the stomach) to be fully engaged. This area houses some of the most potent energies that our body possesses; specifically our artistic, intuitive, and imaginative capabilities. These attributes help distinguish you from everyone else, proving just how special and unique you truly are.","Stone Pairings":"Try meditating with a higher-tiered stone such as Cavansite, , Iolite, Blue Kyanite, K2, Covellite , or Blue Aventurine. All these minerals have energies capable of helping one truly ascend and open up channels to higher realms, dimensions, and deities. The willpower and imaginative energies that one is capable of unlocking with Peanut Obsidian, and any stone above, can help propel one forward during deep meditation. Lastly, do not forget to cleanse your stones. Our favorite ways are through white sage, Palo Santo smoke, or by placing them underneath the full moon to release negativity while capturing lunar energy."},"props":{"Personal

It can be found on Basalt, crystallized in the form of tiny grains, or shaped like small prismatic crystals. Occasionally it's also been seen having formed in large mass structures. Peridot can range in color of nearly every shade of green because of the amount of iron within. There is much debate about when and who officially discovered this stone. However, we like to refer to it’s initial mention around 300 B.C. as the first connection between humans and Peridot. This unique mineral can be found all over the world, with important deposits located in Australia, Brazil, Mexico, China, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and the United States (Arizona). Lastly, this mineral has also been reported in multiple different meteorites that have crash-landed here on Earth (thus making this crystal interstellar).","Meaning & Energy":"Peridot has widely been recognized for its ability to stimulate change between one’s heart and personal will. As our heart releases emotion each day, our sacral chakra is the point of the body that processes it all. Also known as our “second brain”, our gut helps one decipher unstable emotions that may be coming from your most vital organ. During this, a backlog of negative emotions may find themselves embedded in our core, thus causing one anxiety and daily discomfort. Peridot’s green rays facilitate the removal of these feelings through deep meditation and excessive breathing exercises. When one begins to open themselves up to this ancient stone, they must be prepared to fully engage their physical, spiritual, and emotional bodies. All three encompass who we really are, as well as the direction in which we're heading for. When one part of your own personal trinity becomes unbalanced, it can have a drastic effect on all your attributes. Your chakra column is very similar as well and will occasionally need to be realigned and adjusted. Peridot’s energies will offer protection through these personal experiences and help one readjust to the changes in their life.","Confidence, Arise!":"As well as encompassing healing rays for one’s physical and auric fields, Peridot also helps one raise their internal vibration. The attribute that reigns supreme when working with Peridot is one’s own confidence levels. As they raise and begin to set a new standard of living, so does your belief in yourself. This leads one to become more emotionally independent, while giving you the time to figure out where exactly you're headed. We recommend meditating with this stone as frequently as possible to truly get an understanding of your physical place in this world. What is your purpose here on Earth? Why are you searching for answers in the first place? Am I on the right path? These are all questions one must individually search for and through the guidance of Peridot, can be answered within. When you are truly in touch with yourself, you will become much more than a visionary. Instead, you will become a creator with powers beyond the reach of your own imagination. Trust yourself, manifest, meditate, and watch as the powers of Peridot synchronize within."},"props":{"Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Love & Relationships":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/love-relationships","Physical Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/physical-healing","Abundance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/abundance","Prosperity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/prosperity","Alignment of Chakra":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/alignment-of-chakra","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Connection with Nature":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/connection-with-nature","Generosity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/generosity","Chakra Cleansing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/chakra-cleansing"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/399/conversions/Peridot-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/399/Peridot.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Petrified%20Wood.wav","Planets":["Earth","Sun"],"Chakras":["Third Eye","Root"],"Zodiacs":["Aries","Taurus","Gemini","Cancer","Leo","Virgo","Libra","Scorpio","Sagittarius","Capricorn","Aquarius","Pisces"],"Elements":["Earth"],"Colors":["Grey","Red","Violet","Brown"],"id":"petrified-wood","relURL":"/crystals/petrified-wood","name":"Petrified Wood","Formula":"SiO2","Hardness":{"min":7,"max":7},"Related":[{"Lemurian Seed Crystal ":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/lemurian-seed-crystal"},{"Flint":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/flint"},{"Truffle Chalcedony":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/truffle-chalcedony"},{"Lakelandite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/lakelandite"},{"Miriam Stone (Calligraphy Stone)":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/miriam-stone-calligraphy-stone"},{"Diopside":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/diopside"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Petrified Wood":"Petrified Wood, which is technically a fossil and a crystal, comes from the trunks and branches of ancient wood.

Most Petrified Wood found on the market comes out of Madagascar and Australia with occasional commercial deposits seen throughout Africa and South America.","Petrified Wood Forest":"One of the largest Petrified forests still existing today is located in Arizona (United States) and is even open to the public! You can visit the Petrified Wood Forest and explore its 346 square miles with an elevation of around 5,400 feet above sea level. Large petrified logs can be found laying throughout the park as well as ancient ruins from civilizations that settled on this sacred land. Within this forest, large amounts of agriculture and wild animals have been found which has provided the perfect land for archaeologists to study and explore.","Meaning & Energy":"With Petrified Wood comes ancient knowledge and immense ancestral history. Through fossilization, an abundance of ancient earthen energy has been contained within; allowing for the proper practitioner to channel and direct this elestial energy. The vibrations that flow from this wooden amulet provide the essential nutrients for growth and rejuvenation while also unlocking a pathway to our past lives. Through past-life recall, we are able to learn from previous lessons and look towards old wounds to heal. Some scars carry over through physical lives as their wounds may appear eternal. Only through the relieving and release of this past trauma will you be able to free yourself emotionally and move forward. Deep meditation and third eye practices are just a few exercises you can practice to help identify these traumatic experiences. Visiting an experienced Reiki Master or Past Life Healer may be beneficial for you especially if you are experiencing deep blockages that you are unable to move past.","Naturistic Healing":"We have found the energies that Petrified Wood emanate resonate at a much higher frequency when being channeled outside (especially during the hours of dawn or dusk). The sounds of living beings around you can be picked up and enhanced into total life force energy. Much like ancient civilizations, we can use sound and frequencies as a healer, releasing total control to the vibrational energy. Petrified Wood promotes an energetic cleanse and transfer of grounding energy to our physical bodies so that the Earth may heal us once more."},"props":{"Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Past Lives":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/past-lives","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Physical Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/physical-healing","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Abundance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/abundance","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Ancient Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ancient-knowledge","Past Life Recall":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/past-life-recall","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Connection with Nature":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/connection-with-nature","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/275/conversions/petrified-wood-2-%282500px%29-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/313/conversions/petrified-wood-slices-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/314/conversions/petrified-wood-slice-%282500px%29-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/275/petrified-wood-2-%282500px%29.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Phenacite.wav","Chakras":["Crown","Third Eye"],"Zodiacs":["Gemini"],"Elements":["Storm"],"Colors":["Colorless","White","Pink","Brown"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"phenacite","relURL":"/crystals/phenacite","name":"Phenacite","Formula":"Be2SiO4","Hardness":{"min":8,"max":8},"Related":[{"Moldavite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/moldavite"},{"Barite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/barite"},{"Apophyllite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/apophyllite"},{"Sodalite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/sodalite"},{"Shattuckite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/shattuckite"},{"Colorless Topaz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/colorless-topaz"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Phenacite":"Phenacite is a rare beryllium silicate mineral first reported in 1834 by N.

This mineral was recently discovered in 1964 by Sid Pieters, who named it after his late father, Louis Pieters. Pietersite crystallizes in the form of masses in Jasper where the inclusions are pseudomorphs after Asbestos. What that means is that it forms in the crevices of Jasper where Asbestos once was. A common misconception is that this stone is Tiger Eye and Hawk Eye (Falcon Eye). That simply isn't true. Tiger Eye is a macrocrystalline Quartz and Pietersite is a Chalcedony (microcrystalline Quartz). This stone is very rare and only has two known localities, with only one of them still being active. In the 1990’s a small pocket was exposed in the Hunan Province of China, but was closed a few years later due to the mineral being mined out. The only other known locality is in Namibia, where Sid Peters found the stone over 55 years ago. When purchasing this stone just make sure to always question the authenticity., because it is commonly counterfeited. This is because of the rarity and limited quantity of the stone making it highly valuable and expensive.","Meaning & Energy":"Pietersite is a very powerful crystal that activates and unlocks our solar plexus and third eye chakras. When these two chakras are unified together, endless opportunities and outcomes can arise. Our personal will becomes activated and connected to our third eye, which becomes extremely open and clear. Simply holding or wearing this stone can make one feel like their dreams are within grasp. Pietersite reactives our personal will and reignites that fire from deep within. It’s embers are roaring full of drive, focus, determination, and undeniable desire. These attributes that are linked up to our third eye help us find a way to our dreams. We recommend meditating with this stone over your third eye to fully unlock it’s capabilities. Allow the dreams and imagery show you the path you want to take in this world. Once we accept what we want to become, we can then transform into it and our body will go on “auto-pilot”. Before you know it, opportunities are confronting you and new beginnings opening all around you.","Transform To Your Fullest Potential":"Pietersite works to transform your life at a rapid pace, and may feel strong or uncomfortable for some people. We recommend adding in softer transformation stones such as Labradorite, Bumblebee Jasper, Aragonite , or Moldavite. These stones all help make the transition between different fields or ideas much more comfortable and easier to conform too. Moldavite, in particular, is a heart stone and will help protect our most vital organ during these times of change. We house our most important emotions in our heart, and sometimes we tend to leave it exposed when trying new things. Moldavite is here to protect you through any and all journeys you decide to take."},"props":{"Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Motivation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/motivation","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Lucid

It is a calcium carbonate mineral that usually crystallizes in large mass formations. The pink color is caused by tiny inclusions of Manganese, which can range from a light white-pink, to an extremely bold almost violet. Under UV light it emits a radiant pink and is highly soft after due to its fluorescent capabilities much like one of our favorite stones; Hackmanite. Pink Calcite can be found in just about any country with the highest quality crystals coming out of Mexico. The Mexican Pink Calcite is truly one of the softest pink stones that we have ever seen. We still have a hard time wrapping our head around the fact that it is 100% natural.","Mangano vs Pink Calcite":"The technical difference between the two stones has been highly debated for years on end, eventually resulting in a new classification. For the stone to be considered Mangano Calcite, it must have at least 30% Manganese inclusions within the crystal structure. Energetically the stones are very similar. The slight difference being a softer, more loving energy towards the heart that comes from the more pure Pink Calcite crystals.","Meaning & Energy":"The Manganese inclusions cause the energy of Mangano Calcite to focus on the love for your entire body (physically and spiritually) as opposed to the direct focus on the heart (that Pink Calcite offers). We commonly refer to Pink Calcite as being very similar to Rose Quartz in that it is a pure loving stone.

Halite is known as the “natural form of salt” and is a very common mineral found near oceans and salt lakes. This stone can be found in the form of masses and a tubular crystal structure. The specimen pictured below is from a dried up salt lake in San Bernardino, California. Be careful to avoid getting pieces of Pink Halite wet as it may start to disintegrate before your eyes.","Meaning & Energy":"Pink Halite is a stone that pushes one to love every ounce of themselves and who they truly are. It’s a strong stone that helps one release emotional strain weighing down on them daily. Such feelings as self guilt, low self-esteem, and overwhelming anxiety are perfect symptoms of someone who should carry a piece daily. Pink Halite urges one to open their heart and allow all emotional strain to surface so that it may be dealt with. Once one has accepted what has happened, only then can they move on from it.","Crystal Pairings":"Pink Halite works well with a variety of other heart based stones such as Rose Quartz, Atlantisite, and Green Apatite. All these stones have been known to help in opening the heart and increasing the strength of the Pink Halite’s healing vibrations. When working with Pink Halite with the intention of aura cleansing, we recommend using Selenite. Selenite is a known enhancer and is a stone that does not absorb any negativity. When cleansing ones aura, negative vibrations can find a home in stones that are vulnerable, and Selenite is NOT that. We recommend cleansing and clearing your Pink Halite piece with sage or palo santo each time you finish using it. It's a stone that works with the heart, thus coming in contact with the strongest of energies."},"props":{"Clarity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clarity","Love & Relationships":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/love-relationships","Aura Cleansing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/aura-cleansing","Chakra Cleansing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/chakra-cleansing","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Confidence":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/confidence","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Balance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balance","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/164/conversions/pink-halite-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/154/conversions/5ABBD211-1C39-4764-8D03-AEFA16533F58-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/155/conversions/EBAA2865-8AB9-4AA0-A0A6-1615B50C5168-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/164/pink-halite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Pink%20Opal.wav","Elements":["Earth","Water"],"Planets":["Earth"],"Colors":["Pink"],"Chakras":["Heart"],"Parent Property":[],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"pink-opal","relURL":"/crystals/pink-opal","name":"Pink Opal","Formula":"SiO2•nH2O","Hardness":{"min":5.5,"max":6.5},"Related":[{"Galaxyite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/galaxyite"},{"Dragi (Dragon) Jade":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/dragi-dragon-jade"},{"Mordenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/mordenite"},{"Orange Aventurine":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/orange-aventurine"},{"Blue Topaz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/blue-topaz"},{"Tugtupite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/tugtupite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Pink Opal":"Pink Opal is a type of Common Opal that is generally opaque and does not show the “fire” like that of Precious Opals. The color ranges from a bright baby girl pink to a pink-white, cream, or even lavender. Over the course of time Pink Opal has adopted the nickname “Peppermint candy stone”, due to its close resemblances to that of candies. The country of Peru is known to have the brightest and most impressive Pink Opal specimens, but it can also be found in other South American countries, USA, and even Australia. It's very important to not expose your Opal to sunlight, as this stone has water within. This occurrence will cause your specimen to become very dry and brittle, and potentially break.","Meaning & Energy":"Pink Opal is a very powerful crystal when it comes in contact with one’s heart. This stone activates and unlocks our heart chakra and imbues one’s aura with calming, tranquil vibrations. It's a perfect stone for someone to carry if they are struggling with any sadness, especially that of a broken heart. Pink Opal will serve your emotional body when it comes to a breakup, loss of a loved one, or even long distance relationships. This crystal pushes us to look within, and strengthen our connection to our inner self. By strengthening this connection, we become stronger as individuals. This teaches us that we don't have to lean on our loved ones as much, and can rely on just ourselves. Pink Opal gives a sense of individuality while showing just how strong you and your heart truly are. By turning inwards and beginning to work on yourself, emotional strain weighing on one's heart and mind begins to fade away. ","Crystal Pairings":"Pink Opal works well when used with other heart stones such as Green Calcite, Rose Quartz, and Garnet. Green Calcite and Rose Quartz will help in the opening of the heart and provide an abundance of love, joy, self-healing, and happiness. Garnet will help provide the strength your heart and body needs to fully accept difficult situations and begin to move on from them. Garnet is here to push you in the right direction, and exhibit endless amounts of drive, focus, and determination."},"props":{"Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Love & Relationships":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/love-relationships","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Selflessness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/selflessness","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Trauma":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trauma","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Mastering Fear":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mastering-fear","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Sleep":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sleep","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/421/conversions/Pink-Opal-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/161/conversions/IMG_0739-%281000px%29-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/421/Pink-Opal.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Pink%20Tourmaline.wav","Parent Property":[],"Zodiacs":["Libra"],"Colors":["Pink"],"Chakras":["Heart"],"Elements":["Water"],"Planets":["Venus"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"pink-tourmaline","relURL":"/crystals/pink-tourmaline","name":"Pink Tourmaline","Formula":"[](LiAl2)Al6Si6O18(BO3)3(OH)3OH","Hardness":{"min":7,"max":7.5},"Related":[{"Watermelon Tourmaline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/watermelon-tourmaline"},{"Fuchsite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/fuchsite"},{"Dioptase":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/dioptase"},{"Variscite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/variscite"},{"Actinolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/actinolite"},{"Thulite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/thulite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Pink Tourmaline":"Pink Tourmaline is a variety of Tourmaline that can be found in pale light pink, to bright hot pink. This mineral can be seen in raw, transparent, and opaque formations. It’s commonly found in association with Quartz, and other Tourmaline colors. Do not confuse this stone with Rubellite (Red Tourmaline), although they can be found within the same mines. California has been known to produce some of the most amazing Pink Tourmaline specimens, and also has a history of trading them. Chinese Empress Tz’u Hsi became captivated by this gem in the mid to late 1800’s, and soon set up a direct trade line with California Tourmaline mines. Some of the most beautiful specimens at the time were being pulled out of San Diego area mines like the Pala Chief, Tourmaline King & Queen, Himalaya, and Stewart. This very important trade line lasted up until 1912 when the Chinese government fell. Fast forward around a hundred years, and Stewart mine is still producing some amazing gem quality Pink Tourmaline. Other notable localities include Afghanistan, Brazil, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, and parts of Africa.","Meaning & Energy":"Pink Tourmaline is a stone of love, compassion, emotional healing and self love. It helps calm ones emotions in times of distress, and is the perfect stone to carry if you suffer from daily bouts of anxiety. This stone is such a strong healing stone due to it commonly being formed within Quartz masses. Quartz naturally amplifies any stone placed near it, so we regularly recommend Pink Tourmaline to anyone suffering from heavy emotional pain weighing on the heart. For people who have recently gone through a tragedy, heartbreak, loss of a loved one, or simply can't kick that daily depression, Pink Tourmaline is the stone for you. Try meditating with a piece over your heart and allow the crystals healing energies to directly absorb into your heart space. Allow yourself to face whatever it is weighing on you and look for resolution. ","Crystal Pairing":"If your someone looking to use other stones in association with Pink Tourmaline, we recommend Rhodochrosite.

That was until the summer of 2018 when a group of gold miners from the Canadian Pinolite Corporation (CPC) found this mineral by accident in the mountains of British Columbia, Canada. This was historic and exchillerating among those in the geology and mineral collector world. The discovery of Pinolite in 2018 isn’t solely based on any one single person or company. The rock formation was brought to light in a mining report sometime in the mid 1990’s. Quite a lot of time passed since the report, 15 years specifically, until the Kohorst family rediscovered it in 2015. This Canadian Pinolith variety contains very minor traces of additional minerals such as Quartz, Titanite, Zircon, Apatite, and possibly Muscovite. Radiometric dating estimates that this mineral was formed around 500 million years ago.","Meaning & Energy":"The energies that Pinolite radiatie bring about an unfamiliar feeling in all practitioners, no matter the experience. Upon touch, one will immediately notice the subtle, yet soft energy it gives off. It can be described as a cooling sensation that resonates directly to one’s core. One can soon begin to feel a deeper connection to themselves, as Pinolite’s energies work towards unlocking your heart and emotional body. This unique mineral helps one access their crown, heart and root chakra thus creating an extremely useful channel to help ground thoughts, emotions and ideas. Through deep meditation, one is able to go to the depths of their heart and mind to expose their true inner potential. Pinolite helps one look ahead towards new beginnings and opportunities, while serving as a reminder of the constant growth you’ve already experienced. This one of a kind mineral is here to keep you comfortable on this journey, especially as you venture off to create your life path. Pinolite shall serve as an amulet of strength so you can tap into whatever your soul desires. We highly recommend carrying a piece daily so you can allow yourself to become attuned to it’s magical energy.","Connecting to Mother Earth":"Pinolite also assists one in strengthening their connection to Mother Earth. One will notice themselves much more grounded and aware of their surroundings. This is in fact due to one’s root chakra being fully connected to this planet’s ancient energy. Since this mineral is over 500 million years old, it holds countless secrets of Old Earth, consisting of all the energy that once filled this planet’s atmosphere. Once one has become attuned with this stone and fully understands Pinolith’s vibrations, only then will they be able to access it’s true potential. The ability for one to see their past lives through visions is extremely important for one to be able to understand themselves. By decoding this imagery, one can gain knowledge from it, to then be used in any way they deem necessary."},"props":{"Life

& Origin of Plumbogummite":"Plumbogummite is an extremely rare lead phosphate mineral that forms in trigonal crystal structures. Its blue-green color is gained from inclusions of Aluminum. This mineral was first discovered in 1819 by François Pierre Nicolas Gillet de Laumont after the Latin words \"plumbum\" meaning lead and \"gummi\" meaning gum. This peculiar naming is due to its similarity to a coating of sticky gum on top of a crystal. Plumbogummite is a pseudomorph mineral, meaning that it grows and replaces the spot of another mineral. This crystal commonly grows alongside Pyromorphite but has also been found in association with Mimetite, Wulfenite, Cerussite, Angelesite, and Dufitite. It is found in a few localities throughout the world, most notably France, China, Australia, Germany, Austria, and the United Kingdom.* Although this crystal is often found in a blue-green color, is has also appeared in a pale yellow color in Bolivia","Meaning & Energy":"At first look, Plumbogummite may seem like a mineral not from this earth. This foreign-looking stone has immense energies that rival powerful crystals such as Moldavite, Cavansite, and Grandidierite. As mentioned above, Plumbogummite grows in replacement of Pyromorphite; consider how strong this mineral would have to be to overcome this strong stone. Plumbogummite cools Pyromorphite's fiery center with blue rays of communicative light. We may often find ourselves in an internal mental struggle that pulls us into a dark place. When we are in this despair, it may seem like there is no possible way that we can pull ourselves out. Using Plumbogummite as a tool can allow us to open our throat chakra and use this communication channel to grow.","Communicating our Struggles":"","Crystal Pairing":"Plumbogummite and it's pseudomorph stone are often strong and for that we recommend pairing it with grounding and amplification stones. This should often be your centerpiece within a crystal grid and can be surrounded by Quartz points as an enhancer. If you are new to crystals and you're looking to mediate with this piece, grounding stones such as Red Jasper, Black Tourmaline, and Shungite can help!"},"props":{"Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Interdimensional Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/interdimensional-communication","Alignment with the Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/alignment-with-the-higher-self","Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication","Claiming Wholeness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/claiming-wholeness","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Power":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/power","Bridging the Spiritual and Physical Worlds":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/bridging-the-spiritual-and-physical-worlds","Intention Enhancement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intention-enhancement"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/4981/conversions/Plumbogummite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/4981/Plumbogummite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Polychrome%20Jasper.wav","Parent Property":[],"Elements":["Fire","Earth"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Colors":["Red","Brown"],"Zodiacs":["Pisces","Aquarius"],"Planets":["Earth"],"Chakras":["Crown","Third Eye","Throat","Heart","Solar Plexus","Sacral","Root"],"id":"polychrome-jasper","relURL":"/crystals/polychrome-jasper","name":"Polychrome Jasper","Formula":"SiO2","Hardness":{"min":7,"max":7},"Related":[{"Chiastolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/chiastolite"},{"Isua":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/isua"},{"Limonite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/limonite"},{"Eclogite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/eclogite"},{"Fairy Stone":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/fairy-stone"},{"Axinite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/axinite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Polychrome Jasper":"Polychrome Jasper, also known as Desert Jasper, is a variety of Jasper recently discovered in Madagascar. In 2008 while exploring for more deposits of the highly desired Ocean Jasper, the first deposit of Polychrome was accidentally discovered. Since then, two additional deposits have been found throughout the island! Interesting to note is that all material must be hand dug due to the difficult terrain and conditions. Polychrome Jasper only forms in huge masses and got it’s original name (Desert Jasper) from its distinct shades of brown, red, and tan. These bold colors are caused from inclusions by the metal known as Iron. It’s heavily desired in raw form for all crafters, sculptors, and carvers due to the wide audience Polychrome Jasper appeals too.","Meaning & Energy":"Polychrome Jasper is a stone that embodies one’s true self and helps you channel your energies to the ones closest to you. It facilitates and activates one's inner balance, while helping you conform to your current environment. Through this, one can reduce their day to day stress and embody the true elements around them. By doing this, one can not only learn much about themselves, but also where it is they want to go. This Jasper variety is here to serve you and part of that means helping you position your mindset to be ahead of your physical body. When one has a destination or desire in mind, it is much easier to figure out where exactly your soul is taking you and how to get there!","Ancient Earth":"When one taps into the vibrations of Polychrome Jasper, they are imbuing themselves with ancient Earth energy. This mineral contains the powers that come from planet Earth and it works extensively to bind one’s physical body down to this planetary level. The true “roots” of this rock will begin to grow around our etheric body while channelling nurturing vibrations to uplift your life force. This vital energy can rejuvenize your core and re-ignite that “fire” within. Working with Polychrome Jasper serves as a reminder that anything is possible and that you are truly your own creator."},"props":{"Life

Bluestone":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/preseli-bluestone"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Prasiolite":"Prasiolite, also known as Green Amethyst, is a rare silicon dioxide mineral and member of the Quartz family. It crystallizes in mass and fibrous formations, with the color green coming from inclusions of Iron. Prasiolite was first discovered in the early 1800’s in Silesia, Poland. The name “Prasiolite'' was given after the Greek word meaning “leek” (in reference to its color). Since then, nearly all of the Prasiolite on the market comes out of the Minas Gerais region of Brazil. The colors from this region can range from translucent to a dark green. This depends on the impurity level within the chemical body.","Faked Minerals":"Due to Prasiolite’s nickname, Green Amethyst, massive amounts of fake material have been dumped on the market. The unnatural Prasiolite is actually a very low quality Amethyst. It is put in an oven and heated to remove any weak impurities, thus changing the color of the Iron particles within (the same process is done through Earth’s volcanic and thermal activity stemming back 50-100+ million years ago). When looking to purchase this crystal, we recommend doing research into the vendor or store that is selling the piece. It's estimated that 90% of the Prasiolite on the market is actually fake, so be prepared to ask as many questions. Obviously if it is not from Brazil, you can almost guarantee it’s not authentic.","Meaning & Energy":"Prasiolite’s energies reflect the beauty of our home planet which helped create such a rare spectacle. The root and heart chakras become intertwined when holding or channeling the energies of Prasiolite. Rejuvenating vibrations arise directly from Mother Earth and imbue your entire aura in a cocoon of healing energy. This revitalizing effect can greatly increase the energetic flow within and restart your momentum towards enlightenment. The emotions we carry now have the time to be heard and understood. The lingering pain we’ve come to know as trauma or other forms of PTSD can be rationalized with a level head and heart. Prasiolite works to free the consciousness of the restrictive bounds that deter growth, confidence, and self appreciation. It is a constant reminder that we must go forward with love in our hearts, and spread it to all the supportive ones around us."},"props":{"Mastering

":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/aragonite"},{"Shattuckite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/shattuckite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Prehnite":"Prehnite is a calcium aluminum silicate mineral that crystallizes in the form of masses, globular formations, botryoidal, and stalactites. Rarely is Prehnite seen in crystal form, but when it is they are usually very tiny prismatic crystals. Prehnite’s color is usually light yellow or green, but can also be seen as white, tan, grey, or colorless. This mineral was first discovered in 1788 by A.G. Werner. Werner named it after the Dutch military Colonel Hendrik Von Prehn who was in charge of the region where this mineral was found. Since then, Prehnite has been found in China, Scotland, Australia, the United States, and New Zealand. In 2000, an extremely rare pocket of orange Prehnite was discovered in the N'chwaning mine in South Africa. By 2002, the vein was completely exhausted and orange Prehnite has yet to be found again.","Meaning & Energy":"Prehnite is one of the very few stones in the mineral kingdom that links our heart directly to our solar plexus chakra. That means that one’s heart space is now directly attached to one’s own personal will. Our personal will is responsible for pushing us forward to take action each day. It's the driving force behind each one of us as we move forward in chasing our goals and desires. By having one's heart directly in touch with their personal will, our purest dreams become a priority. Instead of leading each day with our distracted and confused minds, Prehnite helps us lead with our hearts. Our heart knows what we truly want to do in this world, and how to find happiness. Simply letting your most vital organ lead you along this journey of life will help you better understand both yourself and what you truly want in this world.","Manifesting Your Desires":"We recommend meditating with Prehnite and using it as a manifestation tool. Grasp it firmly to communicate your dreams, goals and desires. Engage with this stone daily to keep those intentions alive so it can be a reminder as to the purpose of your journey. Doing this repeatedly will not only strengthen yourself but also make the universe aware of what it is you truly want. Prehnite is here to show you that you do indeed have complete control of your destiny. You will realize that when you put all of your energy into something you truly love, the opportunities are endless.","Raise Your Vibrations":"Prehnite is commonly found intergrown with Epidote. Both of these stones offer up a high vibrational energy that channels directly to one’s heart space. These minerals will help jumpstart one’s heart and fill it with endless rays of love and compassion. Be aware that Epidote is a natural enhancer, good or bad. It will strengthen any emotions we may feel at that moment. We suggest placing this stone to the side if you are having a stressful day."},"props":{"Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/higher-self","Angelic Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/angelic-communication","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Attunement With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/attunement-with-higher-realms","Communication With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-higher-realms","Communication with Guides":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-guides","Unity of Heart and Will":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/unity-of-heart-and-will","Living in the Present Moment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/living-in-the-present-moment","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Channeling and Grounding Higher Vibrations":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/channeling-and-grounding-higher-vibrations","Interdimensional Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/interdimensional-communication","Connection with Nature":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/connection-with-nature"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/449/conversions/Prehnite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/449/Prehnite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Preseli%20Bluestone.wav","Parent Property":[],"Colors":["Grey","White","Black","Green"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Elements":["Earth"],"Planets":["Earth"],"Zodiacs":["Capricorn","Taurus"],"Chakras":["Crown","Third Eye","Throat","Heart","Solar Plexus","Sacral","Root"],"id":"preseli-bluestone","relURL":"/crystals/preseli-bluestone","name":"Preseli Bluestone","Formula":"n{(Ca, Na)(Mg, Fe, Al, Ti)(Si, Al)2O6} p{NaAlSi3O8} q{CaAl2Si2O8}","Hardness":{"min":8,"max":9},"Related":[{"Chiastolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/chiastolite"},{"Isua":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/isua"},{"Limonite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/limonite"},{"Vesuvianite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/vesuvianite"},{"Axinite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/axinite"},{"Chrysanthemum Stone":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/chrysanthemum-stone"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Preseli Bluestone":"Preseli Bluestone, also known as Preseli Stone or Preseli Spotted Dolerite, is a very unique and rare igneous rock that crystallizes in the form of masses. This crystal is made up of multiple minerals that include Dolerite, Feldspar (Plagioclase), Diopside, Biotite, Quartz just to name a few. The color can range in a variety of different green hues (Dolerite) with inclusions of tiny white spots (Quartz) and black specs (usually a mix of Hematite, Biotite, and Ilmenite). The only known locality of this stone is within both the Preseli Hill and mountain ranges in western Wales.","Controversial History":"Preseli Bluestone has a long storied past that's shrouded in controversy. The famous Stonehenge in England is made up of 43, 4,000-8,000 pound blocks of Preseli Bluestone. Stonehenge is estimated to be over 5,000 years old (dating back to 3100 B.C) and is thought to have once contained over 80 Preseli Bluestone “standing stones”. The main controversy that entangles this prehistoric site and million year old mineral is how exactly it got to its location. Stonehenge is located in Wiltshire, which is about 150 miles away from the Preseli Hills, the only known locality of this infamous stone. Historians are divided on just about every aspect of this stone, its cultural site, and how it got to where it is.","Glacial Theory":"One side wholeheartedly believes in the “Glacier Erratic” theory, which infers that massive chunks of Mother Earth were transported 150 miles across the UK during the melting of the Irish Sea Glacier. The other leading theory is human labor forces were able to transport these massive stones across large valleys of land. Some historians that share this theory believe it could have taken upwards of 500 years to fully complete the transportation process. Others share the common ideology that these stones were once used in another monument and then dismantled and recreated in Wiltshire for an unknown reason. There is also a third theory or idea that raises the question around the possibility of some “other” way in which these stones got there. That “other” is indeed the question and debate that the third theory focuses on!","Rooted Through History":"In addition to the blocks at Stonehenge, there was also a large number of ancient tools and weapons carved directly out of Preseli Bluestone. These artifacts have been found throughout mainland England, but the exact stone used to carve these specific items is much more intriguing. All throughout England, archaeologists have uncovered multiple different types of Dolerite, more specifically Preseli Bluestone. Since this igneous rock is a combination of multiple different minerals, each stone’s chemical body varies slightly. Through present day research, scientists and historians have been able to directly link the tools around Stonehenge to the blocks themselves; nearly mirroring the exact chemical makeup.","The Mystery Continues":"This long debate has finally been settled and it shows the intelligence level and crafting skills needed to work with this exceptionally unique mineral. Preseli Bluestone has been found to be harder and stronger than Granite, known as one of the strongest materials in the world. For these ancient people to have been able to develop an understanding of how to craft, carve, and sculpt this mineral shows the high level of intelligence of this unknown society. This long standing hypothesis based on the tools surrounding Stonehenge only amplifies the conspiracies and mysteries associated with this rock. How could a settlement of people not leave behind any written or physical artifacts but carve a rock with a hardness of 8-9? We would love to hear your ideas of what happened to these people, as well as what Stonehenge was used for!","Meaning & Energy":"Preseli Bluestone offers up a strong, yet subtle transformative energy that immediately begins to imbue your aura. One’s spirit and energy levels will push them to take action and soar through their current obstacles. Old earth energy, a time where there was massive change through cataclysmic powers, can be channeled through you when tapping into this Dolerite variety. Just as the planet reshaped itself to become a floating vessel capable of harnessing life, so can your own physical bodies. Our own vessels need to adjust to the massive changes that occur in this multi dimensional world each and every day. Mentally it is taxing and physically our bodies become controlled and dependent on emotional stimulus. We look to family, personal friends, and material objects to help distract one from their own personal issues. In some cases, these crutches can even endanger our physical life and even contribute to our own death.","Looking Inward":"Preseli Bluestone is here to turn your attention inwards and begin to fill the void that only you know exists. As you turn your attention towards your own personal well being, one will notice the considerate amount of time they are left pondering about their surrounding environment. This is where these ancient crystals' power really begins to break through and shine. As your emotional body begins to heal its wounds and as your mental health begins to rise above all around you, one will be capable of pushing their physical well being. It's extremely difficult to prosper in all these areas at once, especially when these attributes have been stifled and silenced for so long. Preseli Bluestone makes that a reality and truly embodies some of the purest healing and transformative energies we’ve ever worked with.","Ancient Roots":"We encourage anyone who is struggling with addiction or other vices to really engage themselves in the world of Ancient Earth. Anyone, no matter the skill level, can access these energies and become a part of a more pure world full of endless growth and abundance of love. These rays can and will be channeled through you as you open up your consciousness to the unimaginable. One must trust themselves and be fully invested in their own self discovery for Preseli Bluestone to truly work its wonders."},"props":{"Longevity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/longevity","Past Life

The color ranges from lilac to deep purple, and usually contains white specs from spotted Quartz inclusions. Additionally, minor inclusions of Cinnabar have been reported (a mercury sulfide that exhibits tiny red dots and is extremely rare itself)!","Meaning & Energy":"Purple Jade is an awakening stone that not only activates and attunes one’s spiritual body, but promotes clarity and expansion of the mind. While working with this stone, you will begin to recognize your soul’s desire to ascend and “wake up”. This internal effect is directly due to Purple Jade’s vibratory field. It harnesses trans-dimensional energies capable of inducing remote viewing, astral projection, and cross-realm contact. These experiences can be achieved by EVERY single person if the time, effort, energy, and love is put in. We are all well-suited to advance our soul’s galactic purpose here on Earth. All of these effects can occur in a conscious and unconscious state, making this a remarkable stone to advance and understand your nightly dreams.","Contemplate Your Growth":"We suggest placing this stone directly over your third eye, laying flat on your back, with slow deep breaths. Push yourself to maintain a clear mental state and allow your consciousness to flow freely in the direction of its choosing. At this point, the intuitive effects of Purple Jade can be noticed by the thoughts coming into your mind. Are these daily thoughts or are they unique ideas that have arisen from your subconscious mind? As you contemplate this question after each meditative experience, remind yourself of the power your soul is capable of releasing into the physical world. Your spiritual mission may not yet be understood, but through the channeling of Purple Jade’s energy field, one will begin to find their purpose here on Earth."},"props":{"Psychic

& Origin of Purple Opal":"Purple Opal, also known as Morado Opal, Opal Royale or Violet Flame Opal, is a variety of Opal that was recently discovered in central Mexico in 2011. It mainly crystallizes in the form of masses and nodules without the usual “fire” one thinks when seeing Opal. The purple within this mineral is actually caused by tiny Fluorite and Silica inclusions. You’ll mainly find this mineral cut into cabochons, although occasionally one may find this Opal variety tumbled.","Meaning & Energy":"Purple Opal emanates some of the highest vibrations of any Opal we’ve ever worked with. One’s third eye will immediately become unlocked when first tapping into the energy of this stone. Our own psychic abilities come to life, as well as an increase in one’s mental capacity as a whole. This is in part due to the strengthened connection we have with our third eye and crown chakras. This channel is vital for the processing of higher knowledge sent directly from our spirit guides and guardian angels. These messages can come in the form of deep meditation, our own nightly dream cycles, and can even happen with your consciousness still awake. One will also notice an increase in synchronicities once a strong connect between you and Purple Opal have been made. These moments almost feel like “deja vu” experiences, not just coincidences. One must use these moments as a “checkpoint” on their life path. This should assure you that you are on your soul path with all things falling in place right before your eyes. It is vital that you continue moving forward on your own spiritual journey while using the knowledge that's being channeled through you.","Combining Minerals":"Meditate with Purple Opal in conjunction with other high vibrational stones. Try placing this crystal directly on your third eye with a Quartz point on your crown chakra. These minerals will begin stimulating their respective chakra while the Quartz is emanating frequencies of enhancement. This combination of minerals can truly propel your inner vision forward and begin channeling abilities such as ESP, lucid dreaming, astral travel and access to the Akashic Records."},"props":{"Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Nourishing and

& Origin of Purpurite":"Purpurite is a manganese iron phosphate mineral that usually occurs on the surface of Triphylite due to heavy oxidation. Along with occurring on top of one mineral, it can also be found by itself crystallized in mass formation. This mineral was first discovered back in 1905 by L.C. Graton and W.T. Schaller. They chose to name this newly found rock after the Latin word “purpura”, referencing its purple color. The best known Purpurite specimens usually come from the country of Namibia, but can also be found in France, Western Australia, and North Carolina, USA.","Meaning & Energy":"Purpurite is a powerful ascension tool that helps attune one to higher energies, as well as open up and connect the third eye and crown chakra. Working with this mineral will help raise ones intuition levels and consciousness, as well as assisting one in the understanding of this new found powerstone. Purpurite will help one adjust and become more comfortable with the energy being channeled through your mind and into your third eye. Using and wearing this stone frequently can cause one to have inner visions about their current life path. These visions, along with Purpurite’s energy, can help push one to make the necessary adjustments and changes to better suit their spiritual path. Try meditating with this stone over your third eye to help expand one's mind, as well as provide mental clarity. This mental clarity can be used to help one connect with angelic beings and guardian angels, as well as allowing one to process emotions with much more ease. Purpurite is here to help repair every aspect of one's life, as well as pushing one forward physically and spiritually. This special stone forces us to take action and look ahead towards a growth, self-healing, metamorphic stage of life. This phase is here to help one better understand their life purpose, as well as the transformation into the person your soul so truly wants you to be. ","Crystal Pairings":"Purpurite works well with other high vibrational, third eye unlocking stones. Try meditating with Amethyst, Quartz, Shattuckite, Iolite, Phenacite, or Dumortierite in combination with your favorite Purpurite piece. The strengthened connection these stones create allow one to easily attune to higher realms and dimensions filled with endless knowledge and information. These stones help one better understand the imagery they see in those intense dreams and deep meditation sessions. We recommend keeping a grounding stone nearby if things begin to feel too intense or “heavy”. Try Black Tourmaline, Black Moonstone, , Black Kyanite, or Shungite for all your protection and purifying needs!"},"props":{"Peace of

also known as Fool’s Gold, is an iron sulfide mineral that crystallizes in the form of masses, cubic, stalactites, and botryoidal. This crystal can occur as a secondary mineral, often in association with others such as Quartz, Turquoise, and Lapis Lazuli. This stone was first recorded by Dioscorades in 50 A.D. and was named after the Greek word “pyro” meaning “fire”. This name was chosen because of the sparks created by striking two pieces together. Pyrite has had many uses in ancient civilizations and continues to be used heavily in the production of goods today. Pyrite was a common crystal to be worn during the Greek and Roman Empires. Archeologists have discovered amulets, rings, lockets, pins and earrings that are made from this gemstone. This mineral was also heavily used by Native American Indians as a meditation and ceremonial tool. It is said that Pyrite has immense healing powers and even thought to possess pure magic within.","Determination":"Pyrite is one of the strongest determination stones The Council knows of. It’s energies directly resonate with the solar plexus chakra that activates one's personal will. These energies are what hold the key to accomplishing our life goals. However, they only become achievable by hard work and dedication. Pyrite will help keep you on track until your objectives have been attained.","Manifestation":"This mineral is also very powerful when it comes to manifestation. Meditating with a piece of Pyrite, or simply carrying around a stone daily can have a dramatic effect on your life. Meditating with Pyrite helps activate its powers which then transfer directly to you. We always recommend saying out loud what it is that you want in your life. From that point forward cultivate those thoughts and ideas into a tangible product. Just hearing yourself say what you want can remind you that it is in fact achievable.","Crystal Pairings":"We recommend adding in Quartz or Selenite during these meditation sessions. Both these stones will help enhance the effects and energies Pyrite projects into the world. Adding all three of these stones together in a grid with a throat chakra mineral like Chrysocolla can have amazing effects. Not only are you activating your personal will and confidence but also helping in the communication of thoughts and ideas closest to you.","Working Out With Pyrite":"Pyrite is a great stone to carry or wear when going to exercise. If you’re someone who works out at home, we recommend having a large chunk of Pyrite somewhere in the room. This stone will help keep you focused for the entire length of your workout. You might often notice that when your body becomes fatigued, distractions start to creep into your mind. Pyrite is here to keep you focused and help you maximize your workout. We all have so much untapped potential and with Pyrite next to you, you’ll finally be able to reach that next level."},"props":{"Exercising and Sports":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/exercising-and-sports","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Creativity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creativity","Clarity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clarity","Confidence":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/confidence","Power":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/power","Physical Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/physical-healing","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Focus":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/focus","Balancing Polarities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balancing-polarities","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Determination":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/determination","Action":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/action","Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Mastering Fear":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mastering-fear","Motivation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/motivation","Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality","Luck and Good Fortune":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/luck-and-good-fortune"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/7142/conversions/Pyrite-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/281/conversions/pyrite-square-2-%282500px%29-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/7142/Pyrite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Pyromorphite.wav","Parent Property":[],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Chakras":["Heart","Solar Plexus"],"Planets":["Mars","Earth"],"Zodiacs":["Sagittarius","Aries","Leo"],"Elements":["Earth"],"Colors":["Green","Yellow","Orange","Brown"],"id":"pyromorphite","relURL":"/crystals/pyromorphite","name":"Pyromorphite","Formula":"Pb5(PO4)3Cl","Hardness":{"min":3.5,"max":4},"Related":[{"Dalmatian Stone":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/dalmatian-stone"},{"Schalenblende":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/schalenblende"},{"Imperial Topaz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/imperial-topaz"},{"Pietersite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pietersite"},{"Red Quartz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/red-quartz"},{"Wulfenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/wulfenite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Pyromorphite":"Pyromorphite, also historically called Traubenblei, is a rare lead chlorophosphate mineral that crystallizes in the form of masses, fibers, botryoidal, tabular crystals, and hexagonal prisms.

Pyromorphite is a member of the Apatite family and forms in heavy oxidized veins of lead ore. This mineral is usually found in a light green color, but can also be seen as white, brown, orange, yellow, and even colorless. Pyromorphite was first discussed in 1784 by M.H. Klaproth, but wasn’t named until 1813 by J.F.L. Hausman. He named the stone after the Greek words meaning “fire” and “form”. This name was chosen due to the form Pyromorphite takes once its melted down and cooled. Pyromorphite can be found in the USA, Australia, Germany, the UK, China, and Argentina.","Meaning & Energy":"Pyromorphite is a stone that activates and links one solar plexus and heart chakra together.

This stone takes the saying “if there’s a will, there’s a way” to the next level. One will find that inner strength, and determination within when working with this stone. Pyromorphite helps one channel this energy towards your current intentions and pushes one into action in pursuit of one’s dreams. "},"props":{"Nourishing and Rejuvenation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nourishing-and-rejuvenation","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Expansion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expansion","Focus":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/focus","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Life Path":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/life-path","Living in the Present Moment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/living-in-the-present-moment","Luck and Good Fortune":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/luck-and-good-fortune","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Motivation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/motivation","New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Exercising and Sports":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/exercising-and-sports","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Passion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/passion","Personal Will":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/personal-will","Power":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/power","Prosperity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/prosperity","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Self-Discipline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discipline","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Unity of Heart and Will":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/unity-of-heart-and-will","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Dispelling Negative Energy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dispelling-negative-energy","Action":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/action","Adventures":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/adventures","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Clarity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clarity","Confidence":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/confidence","Courage":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/courage","Creativity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creativity","Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality","Decisiveness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/decisiveness","Determination":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/determination","Enhancing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enhancing","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/221/conversions/Pyromporhite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/221/Pyromporhite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://cdn.reamaze.com/audio/snapup.mp3","Colors":["Pale Yellow","Yellow","Silver","Gold","Brown"],"Parent Property":[],"Chakras":["Sacral","Solar Plexus"],"Planets":["Venus"],"Zodiacs":["Libra"],"Elements":["Fire"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"pyrophyllite-","relURL":"/crystals/pyrophyllite-","name":"Pyrophyllite ","Formula":"Al2Si4O10(OH)2","Hardness":{"min":1,"max":1.5},"Related":[{"Sphalerite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/sphalerite"},{"Orpiment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/orpiment"},{"Magnetite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/magnetite"},{"Wulfenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/wulfenite"},{"Dalmatian Stone":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/dalmatian-stone"},{"Tiger Iron":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/tiger-iron"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Pyrophyllite":"Pyrophyllite is a rare phyllosilicate mineral made up of aluminum silicate hydroxide.

Pyrophyllite’s surface in mass form will usually have silver to yellow fan-like structures running throughout. This mineral is usually seen as a light- green to brown-green color, but can also be found as yellow, white, grey, and light blue. Pyrophyllite was first discovered in 1829 by R. Hermann, and was named after the Greek words meaning “fire” and “leaf”. This name was chosen due to how the mineral reacted when it was heated. ","Meaning & Energy":"Pyrophyllite activates and links one’s solar plexus and sacral chakras together. Its power helps raise one’s creative and sexual vibrations, while also helping one strengthen their confidence levels.

It is the most abundant mineral on planet earth and can be found in the form of points, masses, grains, prisms, and even threaded. This mineral is also one of the very few on earth that can appear in a twinning structure (Japan Law Quartz). Quartz was first recorded in 300 B.C. by Theophrastus and was given the name κρύσταλλος or kristallos. The origin comes from the word “ice” signifying the ancient belief that Quartz was encapsulated in ice. Nicolas Steno discovered in the 17th century that no matter the size or shape, Quartz will always meet at a 60 degree angle. It can be found in every country on earth with important commercial deposits appearing in Brazil, China, South Africa, Madagascar, Australia, Canada, the United States, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Russia.","Macro Vs Crypto Crystalline":"Quartz can appear in two forms and the sub-minerals they are classified as are some of the most popular in the world. Macrocrystalline Quartz is defined as being within any granular structure within another rock matrix or a large crystal structure. Examples of these would be Rose Quartz, Herkimer Diamond, Quartz, Amethyst, Aventurine, , and Tiger Eye. Cryptocrystalline Quartz (also known as Chalcedony) is a group of smaller, more compact aggregates of Quartz. Examples of these stones would be Carnelian, Chrysoprase, , Bloodstone, Jasper, and Flint.","Quartz Colored Varieties":"Due to the number of varieties of Quartz, the International Mineralogical Association (IMA) has broken down this process into two classifications. The first is Quartz colored by minor elements built into the crystal body (also known as lattice). The second being colored by inclusions of minerals or fluids while the Quartz is growing. The former consists of Smoky Quartz, Amethyst, Citrine, and . Examples of Quartz colored by inclusions during their formation are Blue Quartz, Rose Quartz, Enhydro Quartz, and Green Quartz. All of these varieties of Quartz maintain the same hardness of a 7, making it perfect to cut, polish, shape, and form.","Quartz In The Community":"Although impurities occur in every other mineral, Quartz inclusions are highly sought after by mineral collectors around the world. When it comes to Quartz varieties, the specific localities in which they came from are sometimes more important than the inclusions themselves. Metaphysical users have come to love the different species of Quartz and have been capable of extracting the healing energies this wonderous stone offers. Notable varieties of Quartz used in the spiritual communities include , Rutile in Quartz, Chloride Quartz, Faden Quartz, , Dumortierite, and Mango Quartz.","Meaning & Energy":"We can truly say that Quartz has been an evolutionary, energetical, and societal building block. It is everywhere around us; in our cellphones, medical technology, clocks, and concrete. Spiritually, Quartz has been used in almost every society and is highly regarded as a super-frequency stone, commonly adorning the tops of pyramids. It is an essential tool to keep our culture running and helps us advance to not only higher levels of technology, but higher levels of consciousness."},"props":{"Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Clearing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clearing","Physical Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/physical-healing","Cleansing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/cleansing","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Communication With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-higher-realms","Communication with Guides":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-guides","Enhancing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enhancing","Interdimensional Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/interdimensional-communication","Dispelling Negative Energy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dispelling-negative-energy","Intention Enhancement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intention-enhancement","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/398/conversions/Quartz-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/398/Quartz.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Rainbow%20Moonstone.wav","Zodiacs":["Scorpio","Libra","Cancer"],"Chakras":["Sacral","Root","Third Eye","Heart","Throat","Solar Plexus","Crown"],"Parent Property":[],"Colors":["White"],"Elements":["Water"],"Planets":["Moon"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"rainbow-moonstone","relURL":"/crystals/rainbow-moonstone","name":"Rainbow Moonstone","Formula":"(Ca, Na)[Al(Al, Si)Si2O8]","Hardness":{"min":6,"max":6.5},"Related":[{"Seraphinite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/seraphinite"},{"Isua":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/isua"},{"Tugtupite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/tugtupite"},{"Impactite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/impactite"},{"Chrysanthemum Stone":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/chrysanthemum-stone"},{"Blue Halite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/blue-halite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Rainbow Moonstone":"Rainbow Moonstone, also known as White Labradorite, is actually a variety of Labradorite that exhibits flashy colors and rainbows throughout.

was formed when lava once cooled at different times, and captured Magnetite nanoparticles within these layers. The Magnetite nanoparticles cause multicolored iridescence that shines bright when any light hits it. The best localities of Rainbow Obsidian are in Mexico, although a few newer locations in the USA have been discovered within the last couple years.","Meaning & Energy":"Rainbow Obsidian is a stone that activates our root chakra and pulls us back down to earth. It's a stone that can be used to help heal a broken heart, provide support for someone in grief, or simply offer up an abundance of love and happiness to someone in need. This stone is here to hold you when you need it most, while also giving you back strength to help overcome these heartaches so that you may begin to heal. Once one has accepted what has happened, only then can they move on and begin to heal and rejuvenate their energies. The Council recommends carrying a piece on you daily if you are struggling emotionally, and meditating with it when your most comfortable. ","Crystal Pairings":"We recommend using Rainbow Obsidian in conjunction with many other heart healing stones. Rose Quartz will enhance the speed and rate in which one recovers, while also replenishing one's energy field. Rhodonite helps push the trauma and emotional grief to the surface so that it may be dealt with. Eudialyte will help keep one grounded during this difficult time, while also rejuvenating one's life force energy. This stone in particular provides strength and reassurance that you WILL be able to get through whatever your going through. Moldavite will help with the initial unlocking of the heart, and will also provide transformative properties, which makes a transition like this easier for one to deal with. Black Kyanite will provide much needed protection for you and your fragile heart. Just being able to not absorb negative energies within your daily environments will have a tremendous effect on your rate of healing."},"props":{"Abundance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/abundance","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Love & Relationships":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/love-relationships","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Grounding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grounding","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Grief and Mourning":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grief-and-mourning","Nourishing and Rejuvenation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nourishing-and-rejuvenation"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/158/conversions/75AC2A71-3A9E-4ABE-A5FC-BCE92D3A6E10-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/159/conversions/4D637F19-5FD6-440F-8D94-3F709E91172D-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/158/75AC2A71-3A9E-4ABE-A5FC-BCE92D3A6E10.jpeg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Red%20Jasper.wav","Parent Property":[],"Colors":["Blood Red ","Red"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Zodiacs":["Scorpio","Libra"],"Elements":["Earth"],"Planets":["Earth"],"Chakras":["Sacral","Root"],"id":"red-jasper","relURL":"/crystals/red-jasper","name":"Red Jasper","Formula":"SiO2","Hardness":{"min":6.5,"max":7},"Related":[{"Peanut Obsidian":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/peanut-obsidian"},{"Rhyolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/rhyolite"},{"Orthoclase":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/orthoclase"},{"Stromatolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/stromatolite"},{"Grenatite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/grenatite"},{"Mookaite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/mookaite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Red Jasper":"Red Jasper is a variety of Jasper. It is a microcrystalline silicate and member of the Quartz family. The red color is due from tiny Iron impurities and can range in a variety of different shades and hues.This mineral has been traced all the way back to Egyptian times where it had uses in jewelry, makeup, and sacred trinkets. Nowadays, Red Jasper is commonly used for crafting, tumbling, and sculpting. Important deposits of Red Jasper can be found all throughout the world with major veins running throughout Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, and Germany.","Meaning & Energy":"Red Jasper is an exceptional grounding stone that helps one better engage with the world around them. It will eliminate all distractions and procrastination, while helping you achieve your dreams and goals. So often do we allow a little challenge to disrupt our desires, but not anymore. Red Jasper engages the root and sacral chakra, actively channeling Earth’s mightiest energy within. This life force energy is unlike anything anyone has felt before. Nurturing and transformational vibrations begin to fill our aura, while simultaneously ushering out any old negative deities or energies. Once one has a clear emotional and physical body, the real growth patterns can begin. Red Jasper pushes you to grow into the person you truly are, compared to the person social media forces you to be. This stone helps one grow into the most appropriate spiritual version of yourself. One that is capable of understanding the true reality of the world around them and how to discern these ideas and ideologies.","Trust In Your Journey":"Red Jasper is truly a “breakaway” stone that focuses one on their body's inner needs, while removing itself from toxic environments and situations. Almost all negative energy that impacts us is picked up from the surrounding people and places we come in contact with. For this reason, we highly recommend carrying a protection stone alongside your Red Jasper. We suggest doing this because as much as Red Jasper pushes one away from conforming to societal needs, it doesn't protect us from the current negativity that's spreading throughout this world. As long as you trust the journey you are on and continue channeling the magnificent abilities of Red Jasper, hope will soon overtake your emotional body. This vital emotion provides one with a perspective which forces one's fortitude and inner strength to be able to shine through. The only way for you to achieve what it is that you want in this world, is by personally taking action and achieving it. Red Jasper helps you find the courage to say “enough is enough” and remove yourself from any situation that does not serve your highest good.","Crystal Pairings":"For protection stones to use in conjunction with Red Jasper, we recommend Black Kyanite, Black Moonstone, Jet, , and Shungite. All of these stones play a vital role in keeping our spirit alive and well. Remember to constantly cleanse your stones (except Black Kyanite) and release them of any negative energies they may have picked up throughout the day."},"props":{"Mastering

Topaz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/imperial-topaz"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Red Quartz":"Red Quartz, sometimes referred to as Hematoid Quartz, is a variety of Quartz with a Hematite coating. It can be seen crystallized in masses, nodules, clusters, druzy, as well as inclusions within existing Quartz. The color of crystallized Hematite is predominantly red, but can also be seen as dark as maroon, burgundy and brown.","Identifying Genuine Red Quartz":"A lot of Red Quartz sold on the market is actually normal Quartz which has been either heated or dyed. There are 2 major indicators in which one can easily tell a fake specimen from a real one. The first detail one should immediately look for is the locality of the crystal, if possible. True Red Quartz is very hard to come by and only forms in a few countries, with Morocco being the main source for the mineral market. Other smaller deposits have been found in Brazil, but they are one of the countries you must be weary of when purchasing. This is solely due to the volume of faked versions coming from this beautiful country. The second major deciphering method is to hold a piece and examine the weight and density the specimen bears. Hematite itself is an extremely heavy mineral and when combined with Quartz, it definitely stands out from the crowd.","Energy & Meaning":"Red Quartz offers an energy that at first, may feel rugged, extreme and “in your face”. A raw form of Earth’s essence, this coated Quartz embodies pure life, fortitude and protection. Life force energy is the essential ingredient in one finding their way in this ever confusing world. It is the gas to one’s fire and works towards shaping the existence of who we truly are. When one’s flame begins to smolder and die out, the inner spirit you house does so as well. This only leads to negative vibrations, which we all know are easier to attract than positive light and love.","Expansion of One' Self":"When one begins to expand their knowledge about themselves, they will truly understand the strength and willpower they possess within. These dominant features have always been with us, but have gone dormant with time and lack of use. One must awaken these abilities that define us, and use them for the betterment of themselves and society as a whole. Learn how to incorporate Red Quartz into your meditation routines and begin tapping into this vital essence needed to “restart your engines”. As you become more comfortable with this crystal, begin working with it and observe minor traits about yourself coming back to life. Slowly but surely, your confidence will once again reign supreme while the inner workings of your spirit begin finding its way.","Aura Protection":"Although Red Quartz is not a protection stone, it does offer up very powerful protective energies of our emotional bodies and auric fields. Just as our spirit and overall energy begins to strengthen as we grow with Red Quartz, so does the etheric shield this mineral provides. One can freely walk into environments full of negative vibrations without the fear of absorbing them. Evil deities that wish us harm and serve us no good do not stand a chance. So much so, we suggest this talisman for any deep meditation sessions with the goal of “slipping” out of your body. As one projects their very existence into the abyss, they must be protecting the vessel that houses them. Your physical being can be compromised in these states, and can pick up multi-dimensional activity. One must always be caring for and providing the essentials needed for both your consciousness, as well as your human existence. Pure Red Quartz, a true definition of Mother Nature’s power, provides the needed tools for this spiritual journey, and much more beyond that!"},"props":{"Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Longevity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/longevity","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Mastering Fear":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mastering-fear","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Mental Enhancement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mental-enhancement","Motivation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/motivation","New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Nourishing and Rejuvenation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nourishing-and-rejuvenation","Nuturing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nuturing","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Personal Will":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/personal-will","Power":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/power","Physical Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/physical-healing","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Living in the Present Moment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/living-in-the-present-moment","Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Self-Discipline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discipline","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Consciousness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/consciousness","Action":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/action","Adventures":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/adventures","Clairvoyance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clairvoyance","Confidence":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/confidence","Courage":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/courage","Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality","Determination":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/determination","Decisiveness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/decisiveness","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Expansion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expansion","Focus":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/focus","Grounding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grounding","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Life Path":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/life-path"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/3175/conversions/Red-Quartz-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/3175/Red-Quartz.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Red%20Tiger%20Eye.wav","Parent Property":[],"Elements":["Earth","Fire"],"Planets":["Earth"],"Chakras":["Solar Plexus","Sacral","Root"],"Colors":["Red","Blood Red "],"Zodiacs":["Capricorn"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"red-tiger-eye","relURL":"/crystals/red-tiger-eye","name":"Red Tiger Eye","Formula":"SiO2","Hardness":{"min":7,"max":7},"Related":[{"Red Quartz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/red-quartz"},{"Uvite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/uvite"},{"Red Jasper":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/red-jasper"},{"Orpiment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/orpiment"},{"Imperial Topaz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/imperial-topaz"},{"Mookaite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/mookaite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Red Tiger Eye":"Red Tiger Eye, also known as Dragon’s Eye, is Tiger Eye with red shades and hues.

& Origin of Red Tourmaline":"Red Tourmaline (with gem quality pieces being referred to as Rubellite) is a beryllium aluminum silicate mineral that crystallizes in the form of masses, as well as vertical hexagonal pillars. Most specimens are found formed in a Quartz matrix or grown on top of one. The majority of pieces on the market come from localities spread across Brazil, especially the state of Minas Gerais. Superior quality Rubellite has also come out of Africa, as well as the legendary tourmaline mines in Maine and Southern California (United States).","Watch Out For Fakes!":"One huge problem we’ve seen working within the mineral community is the amount of fake and heat treated varieties on the market. It’s very common to see Red Tourmaline that has been altered at your local gem shows or from your favorite online crystal shops. This is due in part to the rarity of the stone, as well as the cost of acquiring it. Two major indications to help you identify authentic Rubellite are its size and color. Naturally, Red Tourmaline forms in very small pieces, with most specimens usually smaller than 2 inches. It’s categorized as a “fine mineral” and is usually placed in a small shadow box or display case.","Spotting a Fake":"When it comes to the color of Rubellite, it may get a bit more tricky in authenticating. Fake dealers have become extremely talented in their craft of how to best take a low quality tourmaline and alter its appearance for good. The first thing you want to do is take a very close look at the red color and examine it for any imperfections. The red color is caused by natural radiation within the Earth, as well as an alteration in its chemical makeup. Lithium and Manganese slowly develop within the tourmaline’s body and deepen the color from pink to red.","Meaning & Energy":"Energetically, Pink Tourmaline and Rubellite are nearly identical. They both offer up harmonious healing energy that can reawaken one's loving and compassionate side. They each promote emotional healing of the body and mind, while helping to expand your spirit to encompass everlasting peace and joy.

It was first reported back in 1813 by J.F.L. Haussmann in Romania, who named it after the Greek word meaning “rose color”. You’ll find Rhodochrosite crystallized in the form of masses, columns, botryoidal and globular formations (which are usually banded). Very rarely will you find Rhodochrosite in crystal form, with only a limited number of the few localities producing crystal-grade Rhodochrosite. This mineral is one of the few in the mineral kingdom that produces rhombohedral crystals, these forms can fetch nearly 5 to 6 figures on the market! One of the few locations that produce near perfect Rhodochrosite crystals is the Sweet Home Mine in Alma, Colorado. Other notable localities include Argentina, Peru, and South Africa.","Meaning & Energy":"Rhodochrosite's focus is to heal yourself and your emotional body. This stone should serve as a daily reminder to put yourself first and take care of your well being. Without yourself being healthy and able, you will be unable to provide love and help to others in need. Rhodochrosite is an extraordinary mineral that is here to help you let go and release anguish, pain, and trauma weighing on your mind and heart. It’s a perfect stone for anyone who struggles with coping or has any form of PTSD. Wearing or carrying a piece daily will help one calm their emotions and push their consciousness into a state of bliss. Rhodochrosite’s calming and soothing energies will imbue your aura with love, peace, tranquility, and life force energy that is here to help you get through any obstacle in your life. In times of worry or sadness, we ask that you hold your piece very close to your heart and feel its stable vibrational output. Rhodochrosite is a high energy stone that will show you that new beginnings and opportunities are right on the horizon, and all you need is a little bit of self-love to move forward."},"props":{"Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Life Path":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/life-path","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Generosity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/generosity","Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Soothing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/soothing","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Physical Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/physical-healing","Trauma":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trauma","Grief and Mourning":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grief-and-mourning","Love & Relationships":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/love-relationships","Compassion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/compassion","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","PTSD":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ptsd","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/169/conversions/IMG_2276-%282500px%29-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/169/IMG_2276-%282500px%29.jpeg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Rhodonite.wav","Chakras":["Heart","Root"],"Zodiacs":["Taurus","Leo","Sagittarius"],"Elements":["Fire","Earth"],"Colors":["Red","Pink"],"Planets":["Mars"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"rhodonite","relURL":"/crystals/rhodonite","name":"Rhodonite","Formula":"CaMn3Mn(Si5O15)","Hardness":{"min":6,"max":7},"Related":[{"Larimar":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/larimar"},{"Infinite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/infinite"},{"Thulite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/thulite"},{"Pink Tourmaline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pink-tourmaline"},{"Watermelon Tourmaline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/watermelon-tourmaline"},{"Fuchsite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/fuchsite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Rhodonite":"Rhodonite is a manganese metasilicate mineral that was first discovered in 1819 by C.F.

As magma during an active eruption brews beneath the surface, granite begins to form. During this time, these subsurface, newly formed crystalline structures are occasionally ejected; creating what we call Rhyolite. Thankfully, this was a common occurrence in the ancient world, as this volcanic activity would devastate entire landmasses and destroy any and all life. Since the 20th century, there have only been 3 small “Rhyolite Eruptions” on record, with them occurring in Alaska (United States,1912), Papua New Guinea (1953-1957), and Chile (2008).","Ancient Uses":"The first known use of Rhyolite is believed to have taken place around 11,500 years ago. The native people in present-day eastern Pennsylvania (United States) discovered large veins of this mineral and soon after began crafting weapons and tools out of it. Although it was not the strongest material (the hardness being a 6), this Rhyolite completely diminished the limits of their own capabilities.","Meaning & Energy":"Rhyolite helps one better understand themselves and the complex universe around them. Energies full of strength, endurance, drive, and transformation flow from this stone, just like the magma that once created this volcanic rock. This flow helps one balance their polarities and realign your chakra column. As this is occurring, one's emotional and mental state will slowly change due to the foreign presence moving into your “core”. As you build a deeper connection with the energies being channeled through you, you may find comfort in absorbing and releasing the blockages that are built up within your soul. These emotions can stem from past traumas or fear for what's to come. As one is unable to reverse the past or control the future, they must live in the now."},"props":{"Motivation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/motivation","Prosperity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/prosperity","Power":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/power","Physical

the form of spheres, botryoidal, and rarely, tiny crystals over matrix. The color is usually a light to sky blue, but can also be seen as green. This mineral was first discovered in 1908 by Domenico Lovisato in Sardinia, Italy. He named it after the mine in which it was pulled out of, The Rosas Mine. This mineral usually forms on Red Limonite and can be found in Australia, Chile, Italy, Germany, Mexico, Iran, and the USA.","Meaning & Energy":"Rosasite links one's heart with their throat chakra, creating a clear channel for one to voice their emotions. So often do we keep our most precious emotions and experiences close to our hearts, making sure its hidden from the rest of the world. This daily task is daunting and will have everyone pushed to their breaking point at some point or another. Holding onto these emotions for long periods of time can cause one to slowly fall into a deep depression and live with intense anxiety and darkness. Rosasite’s energies encourage you to voice your pain, face it, and move forward from it. Learn from these past experiences and grow from them. Rosasite is here to pull you along your journey and be that “light” in times of darkness. Look to this stone whenever one needs a reminder of just how far they’ve come."},"props":{"Generosity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/generosity","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Soothing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/soothing","Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Nuturing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nuturing","Nourishing and Rejuvenation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nourishing-and-rejuvenation","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Enhancing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enhancing","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Compassion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/compassion","Claiming Wholeness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/claiming-wholeness","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/220/conversions/Rosasite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/220/Rosasite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Rose%20Quartz.wav","Planets":["Venus"],"Chakras":["Heart"],"Zodiacs":["Taurus","Libra","Scorpio"],"Elements":["Water"],"Colors":["Pink"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Parent Property":[],"id":"rose-quartz","relURL":"/crystals/rose-quartz","name":"Rose Quartz","Formula":"SiO2","Hardness":{"min":7,"max":7},"Related":[{"Green Calcite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/green-calcite"},{"Thulite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/thulite"},{"Lepidolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/lepidolite"},{"Pink Panther Jasper":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pink-panther-jasper"},{"Peach Moonstone":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/peach-moonstone"},{"Mimetite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/mimetite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Rose Quartz":"Rose Quartz is one of the most common varieties in the Quartz family and is primarily found in Brazil, Madagascar, and South Dakota (USA).

These vibrations are extremely potent and can have a drastic effect on one’s manifesting ability. When working with this crystal, one's personal will, will rapidly go into overdrive. This will eliminate any procrastination or excuse that could deter you from your desires. You will see your focus levels begin to rise as you rid your mind of any and all unnecessary thoughts and ideas.

as Mukhi Stone, is the name given to a dried seed that comes from the Elaeocarpus Ganitrus tree. The name is derived from sand script and translates to “Lord Rudra’s Teadrops”. Rudra is the name of Shiva, a primal soul of the universe, and “Aksa” means tear or teardrops. The tree that Rudraksha comes from can be found in multiple locations, mainly India, Nepal, Hawaii, Indonesia, and Australia. When Rudraksha is found in its fruit form its blue-hued berries resemble that of a small pitted cherry in the west.","Line Formation":"Rudraksha can be found in between one and twenty-one line (which are referred to as Mukhi) formations. You will mainly find Rudraksha seeds between four and six lines( which are the most common). The seeds with one single line going through the entire surface are among the rarest and when found, are highly treasured. Each Mukhi, or line, of the Rudraksha Seed, is found with the same type of symmetrical pattern. For example, Mukhi 4 will have the same pattern, just as Mukhi 11 will follow suit.","Rudraksha through History":"These seeds, which are full of life, have been mentioned constantly throughout religious texts and cultures. Shaivism is considered to be the oldest living religion in the world and is a subset of Hinduism. This community of worshipers chooses to follow Lord Shiva. This Supreme Being is also referred to as Rudra and is known as the creator and destroyer of all things. Some followers believe that Shiva is not only the almighty energy around them but also the spark within them. Many practitioners believed Shiva was the spirit they harnessed as well as the expander of their own personal consciousness. Rudraksha beads encourage the connection between you and the Lord Shiva, while reaffirming the spiritual essence you have within.","Energy & Meaning":"Although Rudraksha is not a crystal, it carries with it creation, fertility, and life force energy. We like to still view Rudraksha as a living essence capable of providing renewed vitality and high levels of soul healing. Our entire chakra column becomes aligned and activated when we choose to access Rudraksha’s full capabilities. Any blockage or misstep in the chakra pattern can throw one off balance and make you feel as though you are out of touch with yourself.

These needle shaped crystals can be found penetrating other minerals such as Quartz, Amethyst, and Hematite. These specimens are highly sought after, and often made into jewelry. This crystal is most commonly found as gold or red, but can also be seen as brown or black. Rutile was first discovered in 1803 by A.G. Werner, and was named after the Latin word “rutilus”,  meaning “red”. This was the color of the first specimen found, thus resulting in this semi-confusing name. The most important localities for Rutile lie in the west African nation of Sierra Leone. This small country produces over 30% of the world’s supply of Rutile annually. Other countries such as Brazil, Madagascar, Switzerland, and South Africa are also important contributors.","Meaning & Energy":"Rutile is a very powerful and high frequency stone. People who have just started their crystal journey should be weary of the high vibrations this stone carries. Even if you are a seasoned practitioner, we still recommend to place grounding stones around your Rutile specimen, as well as carrying them with you when having your Rutile on you. This is one of the very few minerals in the world known to enhance and accelerate every aspect of your life, as well as unique abilities such as channeling, psychic intuition, manifestation, and astral travel. Use caution, as this mineral can also activate any negative vibrations one is feeling or carrying. It’s very similar to the effects of Epidote, where it amplifies any and all energies it is around. Although activating negative vibrations can be important for one to move on and grow, it can also hurt you as well. Aside from placing this stone away for a day when you feel a bit stronger and more capable or dealing with these emotions, we suggest using protection stones in your practice. Allow yourself to garner confidence in knowing stones like Black Tourmaline, , Shungite, and Black Opal will provide protection from any negative energies attacking you."},"props":{"Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Mental

and was first reported in 1747 by J.G. Wallerius. He named the stone “Sapphirus”, meaning “blue stone” referring to the color of the mineral. Although reported in 1747, Sapphire has been traced back to being used 2500 years ago by the Etruscans. Sapphire was also considered a stone of royalty by Ancient Rome, Greek, and Egyptian civilizations.","Yellow Sapphire":"Yellow Sapphire has been known as a stone of prosperity. In Southern Asia, many merchants and salesmen wear Yellow Sapphire somewhere on their body in hopes of enhanced success. A long tradition that is still honored today in some areas of Asia is placing a Yellow Sapphire in the mouth of a dead loved one before they are buried to ensure wealth in the next life. This color Sapphire vibrates with the solar plexus chakra enstilling the will to focus one’s intention into achievement. This stone works very well for anyone who is constantly manifesting and brings back endurance and ambition to ones life. Yellow Sapphire harmonizes well with any other sapphires and Ruby. For enhancing the intensity and the power of the Will, use Quartz or a Herkimer Diamond when working with Yellow Sapphire. For increased synchronicities and activation of the heart in conjunction with the will, use Moldavite.","Orange Sapphire":"Orange Sapphire, also known as Padparadsha Sapphire, is the rarest and most prized out of all Sapphires. Its name comes from the Sinhalese word “Lotus Flower”, referring to it’s pinkish-orange color. This sapphire is highly activating of one's sexual and creative energies and will light the “fire of desire” inside you. Orange Sapphire is a solar stone that brings with it warmth and physical comfort. This special stone connects with the planet Mars, the planet of action, bravery, courage. Mars energies will enhance your ability to move forward with your desires and not work towards achieving someone else’s. Orange Calcite, Carnelian, and Zincite work well with Padparadsha’s fiery energy, while Blue Sapphire can help bring discipline and mental strength to achieve your inner desires.","Pink Sapphire":"Pink Sapphire stimulates the gentle energy of love, release, acceptance, and forgiveness. Pink Sapphire is a very resilient stone and should be used for protection of your emotions and mentality. This special stone allows you to weather the storms of life and stay afloat during that time, while also working on your own life path. It evokes the energy of the heart in conjunction with the mind to push past emotional blockages weighing on you. Pink Sapphire is also a healer of emotional wounds in this life and past life traumas. Pink Sapphire’s emotional energies are enhanced by other heart stones such as Rose Quartz, Kunzite, and Rhodonite. For massive transformation of one's emotional energies, use Moldavite to fully open your heart to accepting change.","White Sapphire":"White Sapphire provides focus and clearing of the mind. It helps one in making decisions and aids in finding one's life path. Each person has many paths that they can go on in their life, but the decisions that we make daily takes away and adds paths to our life. White Sapphire aids in making the right decisions for you by channeling your inner desires. This is a very personal stone that helps you work on yourself, your life, and how to produce your vision into reality. This stone aligns with all the Libra’s out there who have difficulty making decision about even the smallest of things. White Sapphire works well with Phenacite, deepening one’s insight and clarity while enhancing inner vision."},"props":{"High Vibration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/high-vibrations","Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Love & Relationships":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/love-relationships","Creativity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creativity","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Self-Discipline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discipline","Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/higher-self","Abundance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/abundance","Prosperity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/prosperity","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Sexuality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sexuality","Communication With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-higher-realms","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Unity of Heart and Will":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/unity-of-heart-and-will","Personal Will":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/personal-will","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/7386/conversions/Sapphire-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/7386/Sapphire.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Sardonyx.wav","Planets":["Mars"],"Chakras":["Root"],"Zodiacs":["Aries","Leo"],"Elements":["Fire"],"Colors":["Orange","Red","Black","White"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"sardonyx","relURL":"/crystals/sardonyx","name":"Sardonyx","Formula":"SiO2","Hardness":{"min":7,"max":7},"Related":[{"Bloodstone":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/bloodstone"},{"Carnelian":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/carnelian"},{"Garnet":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/garnet"},{"Bumblebee Jasper":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/bumblebee-jasper"},{"Pyrite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pyrite"},{"Galena":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/galena"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Sardonyx":"Sardonyx is the name given to a variety of Onyx  that contains bands of Carnelian. It was first recorded back in 1837 by J.D. Dana and named after the Ancient Greek city and capital of Lydia, “Sardis”. The original word “sard” was also used to describe very dark colored Carnelian up until modern times. This mineral is not necessarily rare but is definitely not a stone you see everyday. Sardonyx is easily faked or dyed due to the high demand constantly surrounding the stone. Next to Peridot, it's also considered to be the birthstone for anyone born in the month of August. When going to purchase this stone, we recommend buying from a reliable and trusted dealer. It's very hard to tell the difference between fake and real because some people are simply unaware of what they’re selling. The most important deposit of Sardonyx is currently located in Sri Lanka, but other notable localities include India, Uruguay, and Brazil.","Meaning & Energy":"Sardonyx combines the grounding and protecting energies of Onyx, with the strength and courage energies of Carnelian. This stone helps bring out one’s inner strength, to move it towards accomplishing your dreams and goals. Sardonyx should serve as a daily reminder that anything is possible in life as long as you put all your energy and focus into it. Carnelian is a stone that will push one to stop at nothing until they get what they truly want. When naturally combined with Onyx, Sardonyx makes one truly believe and realize their desires are within reach. So often do we focus on the negative side of things, like how far away we are from joy, happiness and success that we tend to get discouraged. Sardonyx pushes one past that point and provides the mental clarity needed to continue on our life path.","Combining Stones for Manifesting Your Goals":"Try meditating with this stone alongside other manifestation crystals such as Pyrite, Citrine, or Smoky Quartz. These stones alongside Sardonyx will help one achieve success and prosperity in whatever it is that you want. Carry these stones with you daily as you work towards your goals. Use them to remind you of how far you’ve come, and just how far you're truly prepared to go."},"props":{"Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Love & Relationships":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/love-relationships","Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Courage":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/courage","Power":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/power","Grounding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grounding","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Self-Discipline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discipline","Leadership":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/leadership","Focus":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/focus","Action":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/action","Mastering Fear":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mastering-fear","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Motivation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/motivation","Luck and Good Fortune":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/luck-and-good-fortune"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/7137/conversions/Sardonyx-Photo-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/7137/Sardonyx-Photo.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Saussurite.wav","Colors":["Olive Green ","Venusian-Green","Green","White"],"Parent Property":[],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Elements":["Earth"],"Planets":["Earth"],"Zodiacs":["Virgo","Gemini","Scorpio"],"Chakras":["Heart"],"id":"saussurite","relURL":"/crystals/saussurite","name":"Saussurite","Formula":"[Na](AlSi3O8) to Ca(Al2Si2O8)","Hardness":{"min":6,"max":6.5},"Related":[{"Kammererite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/kammererite"},{"Astrophyllite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/astrophyllite"},{"Campo del Cielo (Meteorite) ":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/campo-del-cielo-meteorite"},{"Blue Chalcedony":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/blue-chalcedony"},{"Purple Jade":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/purple-jade"},{"Agni Manitite (Pearl of the Divine Fire)":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/agni-manitite-pearl-of-the-divine-fire"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Saussurite":"Saussurite is the name given to a rare pseudomorph (meaning one mineral replaced another; a false form) feldspar that commonly contains a group of minerals. Some of these being Zoisite, Epidote, Scapolite, Albite, and other sodium rich silicates. It is only found crystallized in the form of masses, making this a highly sought after stone for master craftsmen and sculptors. Saussurite was first discovered in Mount Blanc some time in between 1760-1778 by Horace Benedict de Saussure (a famed Genevan geologist and mountaineer). It is believed that he originally thought this mineral was actually a variety of Jade. That belief was shared from the time of his death in 1799 all the way up until 1806. That is when Nicolas Theodore de Saussure (his son) correctly identified this mineral as a completely new feldspar, thus naming it in honor of his late father. Since then, this mineral has been found in Australia, China, India, and Russia.","Meaning & Energy":"Saussurite is a stone of transformation, specifically relating to your emotional wants and needs. The energy omitted can be felt upon touch and leads one to eventually raise the question, “What am I capable of?” A question one may have accidentally forgotten or purposely ignored. That doesn't matter anymore, because working with Saussurite challenges one’s entire way of thinking, as it’s energies are directly intune with the heart’s desires. Instead of your mind continuously making decisions based on our lower dimensional reality, your heart only judges from what's within. This important attribute allows one to solely make decisions off past experiences, both physically and emotional. This allows you to use first-person judgment, alongside your intuition to understand what is best for the current you.","Ascend to a Higher Consciousness":"Saussurite is a high vibrational stone and is not only here to raise inner emotions to the surface, but to also ascend your consciousness. As one begins this transformational journey, you must be looking ahead and embrace the life that comes. Our divine beings and spiritual guides are here to direct and protect us on this journey. Saussurite pushes one’s spirits to heights capable of understanding these beings and their messages through deep meditation experiences.","Starting Fresh With Saussurite":"The best piece of advice we can offer when working with this stone is to completely forget everything you’ve been taught and think you know. Start with a fresh slate and only direct your energies to that of which you have personal experiences with. This will provide clarity of the mind and increase the connection it has on the heart."},"props":{"Longevity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/longevity","Physical

lead-zinc ore that contains compact layers (once botryoidal) of Galena, Wurtzite, Sphalerite, Pyrite, and Marcasite. Identifying the minerals within a piece are very easy, yellow being Wurtzite, brown being Sphalerite, silver being Galena, and grey and gold being Pyrite and Marcasite. Galena is the most common mineral, resulting in pieces being extremely dense for their size. It’s estimated that Schalenblende formed around 135 million years ago, when a sulfide rich liquid rapidly crystallized at an unusually low temperature. This specific creation process was rare on Ancient Earth, thus making this stone relatively rare. Schalenblende was first discovered back in 1892 by J.D. Dana. He chose to name it after the German words “Schale” and “Blende”, which means “to cover” or “to hide”. This refers to the number of different minerals within Schalenblende that are hidden throughout it’s concentric layers. The mineral has only a few localities world wide, with many being Northern European countries. Belgium, Poland, and especially Germany have the most important deposits of Schalenblende. Other countries with smaller veins include Italy, the United States, Spain, France, and Canada.","Meaning & Energy":"Just by the dense weight of Schalenblende, one will immediately realize the grounding potentials this stone can offer. With additions of confidence, manifestation, and enhanced personal will, Schalenblende is the ultimate crystal for activating one’s lower three chakras. These open energy portals will aid us in our reconnection to Mother Earth, as well as helping conjure our thoughts and ideas into reality. This unique crystal assists you in crucial decision making that will alter the course of your life path. Schalenblende keeps one’s vision focused on themselves rather than on other peoples’ opinions. The strength you have within yourself will slowly begin to unlock and radiate throughout your body. One can use this energy to remind themselves of their true potential, all they have to do is just commit to it. You will “weather the storm” and become stronger because of it. Your potential knows no bounds, and is full of energy just waiting to be tapped into. Use this mineral as a manifestation tool in your life.","Meditating With Schalenblende":"Set your desired intention into a piece of Schlablende and use it as a meditation tool during your sessions. Place it directly over your belly as it aids in the connection to your solar plexus chakra. One’s personal will is housed in this portal, which can make dreams become a reality. Close your eyes and envision your affirmation being physically set into the stone with every detail playing out in your head. Continue allowing your imagination to flow with positive scenarios and outcomes. This is a simple act of manifestation that can slowly channel into the physical realm. Doing this repeatedly throughout the days ahead will not only keep your mind focused on what's most important, but also your consciousness in line with your soul’s desires. This is the most important thing in the pursuit of happiness."},"props":{"Motivation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/motivation","Personal

Scolecite is formed in slender prismatic crystals and is also found in abundance in large masses. It ranges in color from white, pink, purple, yellow, and red to even colorless.

Satin Spar is the silky and fibrous variety of Gypsum that is abundant and commonly mislabeled as Selenite. Both of these can be found crystallized in the form of masses, acicular, granular, tabular, and prismatic shards. It was first discovered in 1747 by J.G. Wallerius and named after the Greek word meaning “moon” in reference to its blue and pale colors. Selenite is extremely abundant and can be found in nearly every country in the world. Some of the most abundant deposits on record are sourced from Morocco, Australia, Madagascar, Mexico, Brazil, and the United States. Gypsum occurs on every continent in the world and is the most abundant of all sulfate minerals. In the United States, Utah contains some of the most dazzling specimens known to the world.","Naica Mine":"There is a Silver, Lead, and Zinc mine in the Northern Mexican State of Chihuahua called the Naica Mine. This mine has become world-renowned due to the discovery of mass amounts of tubular Selenite rods spanning the height of city buildings! The cave of the crystals is the name given to a corridor nearly 1,000 feet below the mine’s entryway. The chamber hosts some of the largest natural crystals we as a species have ever discovered. These crystals were able to grow at such a rapid rate due to the high temperature of around 150 degrees Fahrenheit combined with 99% humidity. At one point, visitors were able to take a tour of this monumental discovery, but sadly it was closed in 2015 due to potential flooding hazards.","Meaning & Energy":"Selenite is pure white light encapsulated in physical form and is a must-have for every spiritual practitioner. The immense energies of Selenite knows no boundaries when it comes to the restoration of our own auric field and spiritual body. Selenite slices through the air cleansing and recharging any environment it's placed in. It is one of our favorite stones to help remove negative energies that may have been picked up throughout our daily routines. Meditating with a piece over your third eye or crown chakra will allow you to raise your own awareness and intuition levels. Simply put, the expansion effect translates past our own realm and into the dimensions of the dream world. Thoughts, ideas, and visions become more clear, consciously and subconsciously, while awake and asleep.","Crystal Pairings":"Selenite is a great stone to be paired with Black Tourmaline for all physical ailments. When it comes to mental expansion and traveling beyond the planes of this reality, use Selenite in conjunction with Phenacite, Iolite, Cavansite, Dumortierite, Shattuckite, and Moldavite. When looking to activate and unlock your unique personal will, meditating with Selenite along with , Garnet, or Carnelian will greatly enhance your transformative capabilities. Communication is often a lacking point in all of our lives that needs to be worked on. However, if you pair Selenite with stones like Blue Calcite, Chrysocolla, Larimar, Blue Chalcedony, and Turquoise it will not only open your throat chakra but also enhance your word choice."},"props":{"Retrograde":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/retrograde","Clarity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clarity","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Clearing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clearing","Purification":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/purification","Cleansing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/cleansing","Clairvoyance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clairvoyance","Dispelling Negative Energy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dispelling-negative-energy","Aura Cleansing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/aura-cleansing","Chakra Cleansing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/chakra-cleansing"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/4845/conversions/Selenite-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/4846/conversions/Selenite-%282500px%29-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/4845/Selenite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Septarian.wav","Parent Property":[],"Planets":["Earth"],"Elements":["Earth"],"Zodiacs":["Taurus"],"Colors":["Yellow","Grey","Brown"],"Chakras":["Root"],"id":"septarian","relURL":"/crystals/septarian","name":"Septarian","Formula":"n{CaCO3} p{CaMg(CO3)2}","Hardness":{"min":3,"max":4},"Related":[{"Nuummite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/nuummite"},{"Purpurite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/purpurite"},{"Gyrolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/gyrolite"},{"Blue Halite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/blue-halite"},{"Danburite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/danburite"},{"Shaman Stone":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/shaman-stone"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Septarian":"Septarian Nodule, also referred to as Dragon Stone, is a tri color concretion composed of Aragonite  (the brown), Calcite, (the yellow), and Limestone (the grey). The name comes from the word “Septaria”, which usually refers to any concretion with internal cavities or cracks. This unique mineral was formed around 50 to 70 million years ago during Earth’s Cretaceous Period. Sea life during that time became attracted to the molten sediment that was produced by these massive volcanic eruptions. Overtime as sea life began to die, their chemical composition became enriched in sedimentary rock, forming the nodules we see today. As oceans began to recede around the world, the water within soon dried out and massive cracks formed internally. The chemicals within the dead sea life eventually crystallized and formed Aragonite “crusts” and drusy Calcite crystals. Most Septarian Nodules are from Utah, where the Gulf Of Mexico once spanned to, as well as Madagascar, which was under very similar conditions during that time period. ","Meaning & Energy":"Septarian Nodule is a powerful grounding stone that awakens one’s connection to Mother Earth and the nurturing energy she provides. Ones root chakra will become activated when working with this stone, as well as vital life force energy being channeled throughout your body. This energy being transferred through you is that of ancient origin, being a combination of 3 powerful minerals that will help in the realignment of one's chakra column. One may experience an “inner awakening” when connecting with this stone, driving drastic change and new habits to replace ones old daily habits. Septarian is a perfect tool for anyone going through some sort of drastic change in their life and can help one repair their emotional body. Carrying this stone daily will provide a protective shield around ones aura full of power earthen energy that will help one slowly heal from the inside out. It may be a long drawn out process, but one can fully repair their emotional body and push through any lingering trauma.","Crystal Pairing":" Try pairing this stone with Quartz to enhance its energy output and the strength at which it vibrates."},"props":{"Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Life

& Origin of Seraphinite":"Seraphinite, also known as Serafine and Serafinite, is an extremely rare gem variety of Clinochlore, a hydrous magnesium iron aluminum silicate. It can be seen in mass formation as well as botryoidal, with the crystal system being Monoclinic (unequal sides). It’s usually found with high flash chatoyancy in raw form and becomes incredibly shiny when polished. This mineral is usually seen in a very dark green color that almost resembles deep Emerald  or even black. Seraphinite has only one known locality in the entire world, being the Korshunovskoye Iron deposit in Irkutsk Oblast, Russia. Famed Russian mineralogist Nikolay Koksharov discovered this mineral and it's believed that he named it after the group of angels in the Bible known as the “Seraphim”.","Meaning & Energy":"Seraphinite has an exceptionally high energy output that can be felt upon touch. Even practitioners who deem themselves as “experienced” may have a hard time withstanding the vibrations that emanate from this stone. One may feel a sense of warmth overcome their bodies, with a clear mind to follow. This can all happen within minutes of being around your first Seraphinite piece. Its hands down one of the strongest crystals we’ve ever come in contact with and completely changes one’s perception of a “high vibration stone”. This special mineral is the embodiment of that term and can drastically alter one’s life. Seraphinite allows us to question our day to day actions and the environment we put ourselves in. The awareness and mental capabilities one unlocks is unparalleled to any other stone we’ve worked with. Our intuition and intellect heighten, all while maintaining a clear and level head. This allows one to self reflect and truly decipher the things or people around them. One will begin to notice different aspects or energies of their environment that they can change where they see fit. These changes can also include your own hobbies or interests which may no longer serve you on your life path.","Growth Cycle":"Seraphinite pushes one into an accelerated growth cycle where your soul takes the lead instead of your mind and heart. Your soul is the true embodiment of your consciousness and it will constantly show you your true desires. You will have a strengthened connection to your spirit, becoming more in touch with your true wants and needs. This can be a drastically different path from which you are currently on due to a complete shift in one’s way of thinking. Either way Seraphinite protects you along your journey and should serve as a reminder of the strength you embody. One must have total trust in themselves and a high level of confidence to make such sudden changes in their life. The universe sees these complete shifts in one’s life and rewards those who follow their dreams. Seraphinite is the ultimate talisman for those who are ready for a fresh start that is full of new beginnings and endless opportunities.","Balancing Your Chakras":"Seraphinite also helps anyone experiencing troubles in their chakra column. This unique crystal helps one find inner balance and can realign their entire chakra system. When one chakra is out of place, it can throw your entire body and mind off until accurately addressed. Try laying down with your eyes shut and place a piece of Seraphinite on the body part with the most stress. Envision emerald rays radiating off this crystal and absorbing into your body through your pores. Push your mind into a deep state of relaxation where one is able to feel the constant pulsation of energy Seraphinite creates. These are healing rays full of light that can cleanse one's entire body and aura. Do this repeatedly throughout the weeks and months ahead to not only attune to Seraphinite’s unique energy, but also strengthen your entire chakra column. Lastly, we urge you to always cleanse your crystal with sage or palo santo. Seraphinite does absorb the energy it soaks up and needs to be cleansed daily. Even if you are just carrying or wearing it, we still believe in cleansing."},"props":{"Living in the Present

formed in Serpentinite rock. It commonly crystallizes in the forms of masses, fibrous grains, and flat-like plates. The colors can vary from light and dark greens to brown, yellow, white, and grey. Commonly known Serpentine minerals that have been independently verified are Lizardite, Atlantisite, Greenstone, and Infinite. The name was given to this group of minerals in 1564 by Georgius Agricola after the Latin word “serpens” for its similarity to that of a snake or serpent. Serpentine can be found in just about every continent on earth with an abundance specifically located in South Africa, Australia, Austria, Germany, France, Madagascar, Peru and the United Kingdom.","Kundalini Energy":"Serpentine helps us access our Kundalini Energy which is an ancient Tantra teaching that involves a vibration that sits at the base of our spine. While dormant, this energy is believed to be coiled up, much like a serpent. This inner power is accessed through realms such as deep meditation, the use of Serpentine crystals, and yoga. Once released, an effect known as a Kundalini Awakening will begin to take place. When experiencing this great awakening you may feel more in-tune with yourself and notice signs of your inner intuition come to life. This intellectual upgrade tends to lead to an expansion of the mind and attunement to higher realms. To reach these realms one must be willing to open their pineal gland and restore the true confidence of our own mental abilities.","Meaning & Energy":"Overall, Serpentine is capable of realigning our entire chakra system and acts as a driving force in altering our current life path. Serpentine has a unique rooting with nature and is said to help contact interdimensional beings. We suggest mediating outside to experience the earthen channeling effect that Serpentine emits. While attempting to ascend your consciousness you must take into account the life force energy that is around us. We are all interconnected to a spiritual mass that is present for us to tap into at any moment."},"props":{"Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Love & Relationships":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/love-relationships","Soothing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/soothing","Physical Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/physical-healing","Connection with Nature":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/connection-with-nature","Kundalini":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/kundalini","Animal Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/animal-communication","Selflessness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/selflessness"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/69/conversions/3636fdf12b98f708dcd3c392ff9d6e09-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/69/3636fdf12b98f708dcd3c392ff9d6e09.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Shaman%20Stone.wav","Parent Property":[],"Zodiacs":["Aries","Aquarius","Libra"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Colors":["Brown"],"Elements":["Earth"],"Planets":["Earth"],"Chakras":["Crown","Third Eye","Throat","Heart","Sacral","Solar Plexus","Root"],"id":"shaman-stone","relURL":"/crystals/shaman-stone","name":"Shaman Stone","Formula":"n{Fe2+, 3+1-25O1-32} p{SiO2}","Hardness":{"min":5,"max":5},"Related":[{"Pinolith (Pinolite)":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pinolith-pinolite"},{"Auralite-23":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/auralite-23"},{"Seraphinite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/seraphinite"},{"Muscovite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/muscovite"},{"Pietersite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pietersite"},{"Danburite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/danburite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Shaman Stone":"Shaman Stone, also known as Mochi Marbles, Boji Stones, Navajo Berries and Hopi Marbles, are an Iron oxide and sandstone concretions found in southern Utah, near the north side of the Grand Canyon. They are believed to have formed over 100 million years ago, when naturally flowing water began moving iron minerals and sand together. Overtime, this naturally created these concretions which can range from pea size, all the way up to the size of a softball. These stones are fairly common in southern Utah, but can be troublesome to get your hands on them. Shaman Stones are mostly found on government owned land, national parks and forests, as well as Native American reservations where collecting is prohibited. ","Meaning & Energy":"Shaman Stones were heavily used by the Moqui Indians (Hopi Tribe) who resided in the nearby Moqui Desert. Shamans within the tribe would use these stones in ritual practices and meditations with other tribe members. They referred to them as “spiritual talismans” and was used in channeling higher knowledge and contacting angelic beings and spirit guides. Another legend talks of how deceased spirits of the tribe would come at night and play with the “marbles”, and move them before daybreak. The people of the tribe viewed this as signs from their loved ones in the afterlife attempting to contacting them."},"props":{"Leadership":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/leadership","Nuturing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nuturing","Nourishing and

Thankfully with the power of a Shiva Lingam, the polaric points can help guide our two most important bodies (physical & emotional)."},"props":{"Exercising and Sports":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/exercising-and-sports","Sexuality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sexuality","Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Balance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balance","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Clarity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clarity","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Purification":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/purification","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Balancing Polarities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balancing-polarities","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Kundalini":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/kundalini","Ancient Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ancient-knowledge","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Fertility and Pregnancy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/fertility-and-pregnancy","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/434/conversions/Shiva-LIngam-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/434/Shiva-LIngam.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Shungite.wav","Planets":["Saturn"],"Chakras":["Crown","Third Eye","Throat","Heart","Solar Plexus","Sacral","Root"],"Elements":["Fire","Wind","Storm"],"Colors":["Black"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Zodiacs":["Scorpio","Capricorn","Cancer"],"id":"shungite","relURL":"/crystals/shungite","name":"Shungite","Formula":"n{C} p{C60}","Hardness":{"min":4,"max":4},"Related":[{"Raquirite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/raquirite"},{"Specular Hematite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/specular-hematite"},{"Noble Shungite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/noble-shungite"},{"Celestite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/celestite"},{"Jade":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/jade"},{"Desert Rose Selenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/desert-rose-selenite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Shungite":"Shungite is a carbon-based stone that was first discovered in the Shun’ga Village in Karelia Republic (northern Region of Russia). Named after the village in which it was discovered, this mineraloid was first described in 1879 and contains more than 98% Carbon. Although primarily found in Russia, Shungite has also been found in Austria, the Congo, India, and the United States.","Noble Science Prize":"In 1996 the Nobel Peace Prize for science was awarded to three scientists that found naturally occurring antioxidants within Shungite. These new forms of the element carbon, are known as “fullerenes” and have been used in scientific breakthroughs ever since. Peter the Great knew of Shungite’s healing capabilities and set up the first Russian spa near the deposit, to make use of its water purifying abilities. Peter even insisted that his soldiers carry a piece of Shungite with them to purify their water on the go.","Noble Shungite":"A more pure form of Shungite called Noble Shungite, or Elite Shungite is extremely rare and has a silver-ish tint on its surface. The pure stone’s rarity makes it expensive and also very challenging to get your hands on. Its physical structure is almost completely Carbon, leading to fewer impurities of other elements. Shungite has vast amounts of healing powers that can assist any person in need. Shungite naturally has electrical conducting properties that help inhibit electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic fields, which contain trace amounts of radiation, are produced by all common household electronics. Placing Shungite at the base of the electronic and on the back of your phone will help drastically reduce the radial output without interfering with the operations.","Meaning & Energy":"Using Shungite has multiple effects on the body, including activation of all 7 main chakras. It’s used to detoxify the body and rid the mind of negativity while contributing as an aura cleanser. Shungite is a must-have for people with difficult and uncontrollable emotions. It allows for light to fill the body and negativity to be removed. Due to Shungite’s large deposits, the world is able to see many forms of Shungite. Wearing any piece of jewelry or having any form of it on you will greatly increase your protective shield. Shungite’s deep rooting capability will house sacred energies that can be easily summoned for shielding of any kind."},"props":{"EMF":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emf","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Clarity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clarity","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Clearing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clearing","Cleansing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/cleansing","Elimination Toxins":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/elimination-toxins"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/418/conversions/Shungite-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/419/conversions/64b9f2054d2c5f6d2606e303ccca2b94-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/418/Shungite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Smithsonite.wav","Colors":["Light Blue","Pink","Yellow","Brown","Green","Blue"],"Parent Property":[],"Chakras":["Root","Crown","Third Eye","Throat","Heart","Solar Plexus","Sacral"],"Planets":["Neptune"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Zodiacs":["Virgo","Pisces"],"Elements":["Water"],"id":"smithsonite","relURL":"/crystals/smithsonite","name":"Smithsonite","Formula":"Zn(CO3)","Hardness":{"min":4,"max":4.5},"Related":[{"Pink Tourmaline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pink-tourmaline"},{"Watermelon Tourmaline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/watermelon-tourmaline"},{"Garnierite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/garnierite"},{"Dioptase":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/dioptase"},{"Flower Agate":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/flower-agate"},{"Actinolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/actinolite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Smithsonite":"Smithsonite, also known as Zinc Spar, is a zinc carbonate mineral that is most commonly found in botryoidal, masses (sometimes with a druzy surface), and stalactites. It's very rare to find this mineral in its crystallized form, which is rhombohedral shaped. Smithsonite can be found in a variety of colors such as yellow, brown, purple, white, green, grey, and most notably, its Turquoise-blue shade. This mineral was commonly mistaken for Hemimorphite, or Calamine, until 1832 when F.S. Beaudant differentiated it. He named the mineral after the English mineralogist James Smithson, who first identified the crystal in 1802. This is the same James Smithson who was the founding donor of the Smithsonian Institution. Deposits of this unique Zinc mineral have been reported in Greece, Australia, South Africa, Mexico, and the USA.","Meaning & Energy":"Smithsonite is a powerful stone that is here to soothe your mind and calm your emotions. It helps one refresh their emotional body and helps in the revaluation of the situations causing distress. Smithsonite pushes one's mind into a state of clarity when emotions may feel overwhelming. This crystal pushes one to find resolution to move forward from any and all negative situations. By helping one achieve clarity of the mind, one may soon begin to ask themselves, “Is it truly worth it?”. The amount of energy needed to continue holding grudges and arguments is overwhelming for even the strongest person, and can not be held onto when trying to move forward. Once one has accepted that, only then will they know the true effects of the mighty Smithsonite stone."},"props":{"Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Sense

gets it's black and/or smoky color from natural radiation (in reference to the proximity of other radioactive minerals) or natural irradiation. This particular Quartz variety forms in masses and crystal structures of all sizes. It can be found all over the world where the best specimens have come from Africa, Australia, and the New England region of the United States.","Meaning & Energy":"Smoky Quartz helps one ground themselves to Earth, in addition to opening up the root chakra and solar plexus. It’s the perfect stone for people who constantly find themselves with a wandering mind and an inability to focus. This stone is here to assist in not only clearing your mind but to allow you to be more level headed. Smoky Quartz can also help you find the drive and determination that sometimes feels lost in our daily lives. These personal tools can assist you to bring your dreams, wants, and desires into reality. By putting your own needs first, this stone can become one of the strongest manifestation tools in your arsenal. It has remarkable transformation strength that can help push one into a new life direction if they’re unhappy with the status quo. We recommend carrying a piece or speaking to it daily to let the universe hear the path in which you want to take.","Transmute Negative Energy":"Smoky Quartz has always been known as one of the strongest and most effective tools for dissolving and transmuting negative energies. Not only will it protect one's aura and body from negative vibrations, but also change those existing negative energies into something more positive. For example, Smoky Quartz can help one break bad habits and patterns by showing your true inner strength. This self-revelation can show you how much self-control you actually possess. There will be times in our lives where we will have to face adversity and not cower in the face of distress. Smoky Quartz can help you manifest that specific power needed to tackle those challenges. ","Stones to Use With Smoky Quartz":"Smoky Quartz works well with other grounding stones such as , Black Tourmaline, and Black Kyanite. We highly recommend meditating with one or all of these stones to help with the organization of thoughts, ideas, and interests. If you’re someone who is looking to enhance their meditation sessions surrounding manifestation, we suggest using Epidote with Smoky Quartz. Epidote is a natural enhancer that will allow you to open your eyes and bring clarity to the many decisions you face. By using these stones together it will help one speak from the heart when pursuing your most desired dreams. "},"props":{"Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Balance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balance","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Grounding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grounding","Purification":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/purification","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Organization":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/organization","Personal Will":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/personal-will"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/277/conversions/IMG_3344-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/277/IMG_3344.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Snowflake%20Obsidian.wav","Planets":["Earth"],"Chakras":["Third Eye","Root"],"Zodiacs":["Virgo"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Colors":["Black","White"],"Elements":["Earth"],"id":"snowflake-obsidian","relURL":"/crystals/snowflake-obsidian","name":"Snowflake Obsidian","Formula":"SiO2","Hardness":{"min":5,"max":5.5},"Related":[{"K2":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/k2"},{"Stellar Beam Calcite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/stellar-beam-calcite"},{"Shattuckite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/shattuckite"},{"Barite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/barite"},{"Okenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/okenite"},{"Lazulite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/lazulite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Snowflake Obsidian":"Snowflake Obsidian is a type of Obsidian that gets its “snowflakes” from inclusions of the white mineral, Cristobalite.

Both these stones strengthen and purify the mind, which heavily reduces the risk of sudden urges that would make you relapse into these habits again.

It was first discovered in 1811 by Europeans in Greenland. However, it's been traced back to the Caral People (2600-2000 B.C.) near Lima for trading purposes. It is rarely seen in crystal form and can sometimes be found intertwined with White Calcite. Sodalite is primarily blue but can be found as white, yellow, red, and green. Members of this mineral group include Lazurite, Haüyne, and Nosean.","Meaning & Energy":"Sodalite is a stone of insight and mental enhancement. These vibrations are the key to unlocking deepened intuition. By expanding these energies, it allows us to get over the mental hurdles that we may struggle with daily. Sodalite enhances your mental capabilities and allows the natural contradictions of your mind to slowly weaken. It is a personal stone in the sense that it dives deep into your subconscious and forces you to evaluate yourself. Through this, you will be able to highlight your strengths and weaknesses.","Communication Ley Lines":"Our throat chakra is often a key energy ley line within our body that is not expressed in the correct manner. Working with Sodalite helps us expand this communicative center to vocalize the internal thoughts we may not be able to understand at times. Interpreting others is a challenge, but interpreting our own feelings can seem like even more of a challenge. We have a biased perspective on our internal monologue and often sway decisions to make ourselves feel better and not be put in an uncomfortable situation. Sodalite links our throat chakra and third eye chakra together helping us better understand our thoughts and communicate in a correct manner. If you are someone who often stumbles over their words, or cannot find their voice in life, Sodalite is most definitely a stone to keep in your arsenal.","Crystal Pairings":"Additionally, Sodalite pairs well with Lapis Lazuli when trying to increase mental capabilities and will assist in bringing truthful insight. Moldavite will act almost as an enhancer with its transformational capabilities; it will only strengthen the lasting effect of the Sodalite. Rose Quartz and Sodalite conjure some of the highest levels of self-healing. Both stones have very high vibrational frequencies making it easy to release negativity and replace it with pure enlightenment."},"props":{"Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Clairvoyance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clairvoyance","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Self-Discipline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discipline","Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/higher-self","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Angelic Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/angelic-communication","Communication With Higher Realms":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-higher-realms","Communication with Guides":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/communication-with-guides","Interdimensional Communication":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/interdimensional-communication","Intention Enhancement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intention-enhancement","Alignment with the Higher Self":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/alignment-with-the-higher-self"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/433/conversions/Sodalite-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/13/conversions/6bc795f81a35c3f7fae9f81c0a604574-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/433/Sodalite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Sonora%20Sunrise.wav","Parent Property":[],"Elements":["Fire","Water","Earth"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Colors":["Orange","Black","Red","Green"],"Zodiacs":["Virgo","Scorpio","Gemini","Libra"],"Planets":["Earth"],"Chakras":["Crown","Third Eye","Throat","Heart","Solar Plexus","Sacral","Root"],"id":"sonora-sunrise","relURL":"/crystals/sonora-sunrise","name":"Sonora Sunrise","Formula":"Cu2-xAlx(H2-xSi2O5)(OH)4•nH2O","Hardness":{"min":3,"max":4},"Related":[{"Nundoorite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/nundoorite"},{"Brochantite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/brochantite"},{"Peanut Obsidian":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/peanut-obsidian"},{"Green Garnet":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/green-garnet"},{"Flint":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/flint"},{"Maligano Jasper":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/maligano-jasper"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Sonora Sunrise":"Sonora Sunrise, also known as Sonora Sunset and Cuprite Chrysocolla, is a hydrous copper oxide mineral containing Brochantite (with occasional Chrysocolla) and red Cuprite (Chalcotrichite, the orange variety of Cuprite may also be found in small amounts). A black banding of Tenorite (a Copper  oxide) divides the two minerals, with the rock matrix being Limestone. Sonora Sunrise was recently discovered in 2006 at the Milpillas Copper Mine. This mine is about 50 miles south of the United States-Mexico border, near the town of Santa Cruz, Sonora, Mexico. Its name was derived from the similarly gorgeous colorful sunrises the Mexican state is widely known for.","Meaning & Energy":"Sonora Sunrise is quite an odd stone, especially when referring to it’s energies. Oddly enough, this copper oxide mineral helps one communicate love, change, manifestation, and inner vitality all at once. Yes, a crazy and potent stone! It's almost fitting that this mineral has only been on the market for around a decade, being comparable to just about any other copper mineral we have worked with. Its energies are very similar to Brochantite especially when meditating with this crystal 1 on 1. With nothing else to compare it to except a small part of itself, you can understand why we hold this mineral in such high regard. We believe every single person, practitioner or not, should have a piece of Sonora Sunrise on them. With the hustle and bustle of the 21st century consuming more and more of our own personal time, this self-betterment amulet is nearly vital for one to “catch up” with their own emotions and well being. One must fully engage their energies with their piece of Sonora Sunset through deep meditation to witness the strength this crystal truly possesses.","Reset Your Daily Energy":"Try placing it directly over your throat or heart chakra and close your eyes while taking a long deep breath. Do this repeatedly, with every breathing cycle becoming slower and more relaxed than the last. As one becomes in touch with themselves and their internal being, a tingling should begin occurring on whichever chakra the stone is over. This should serve as a reminder that your body is fueled by energy whether good or bad. Sonora Sunrise is here to teach you that vital lesson and provide a rejuvenating effect on your entire consciousness. Use this stone to help “reset” any daily energy that lingers within and allow yourself to channel all the love and light this crystal is emanating."},"props":{"Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Living in the Present

& Origin of Specular Hematite":"Specular Hematite, also known as Specularite, is a variety of Hematite with a shiny exterior surface with black undertones. The shimmering effect is caused by aggregate pockets of incredibly shiny flakes of Hematite as well as minor traces of Mica. Specular Hematite can be found worldwide from the United States to Canada, Italy, Brazil, Switzerland, Sweden, Venezuela, and England. However, the supply has become increasingly rare.","Meaning & Energy":"Specular Hematite carries all of the effects of Hematite while also offering the ability to ground higher vibrations into the physical plane. This is due in part to the root and crown chakras becoming open and connecting themselves. Both of these chakras are on opposite points of the body, making it extremely difficult to solidify a link between the two. In doing so, we can bring our thoughts and desires down to Mother Earth so that she may help them come to fruition. She is of great assistance and can push us in specific directions, ultimately helping our path towards individuality.","Confidence Along Your Journey":"Spirituality is often something that we feel nervous to express to others. Our confidence transcends to all aspects of our lives and being a full-hearted practitioner will only yield greater results. We must truly put all of our energy and beliefs into what we are doing. There is no need to be afraid of judgment from others as this is your OWN journey, not theirs. Society has placed unneeded restrictions on certain belief systems and this may be due to fear or misunderstandings. That is where a spiritual being such as yourself can play a role here on earth, by helping and advising others on their own spiritual mission. Specular Hematite helps us connect to all the other spiritual workers around the world. Imagine this stone as a pocket amulet capable of providing answers to the questions directly in front of you. We must take this journey of life one step at a time. Allow the weight and visual effects of this stone to be a reminder of that!"},"props":{"Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Grounding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grounding","EMF":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emf","Mastering Fear":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mastering-fear","Bridging the Spiritual and Physical Worlds":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/bridging-the-spiritual-and-physical-worlds"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/166/conversions/Specular-Hematite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/166/Specular-Hematite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Sphalerite.wav","Colors":["Metallic","Silver","Black","Brass-Yellow","Brown","Yellow"],"Parent Property":[],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Chakras":["Root","Sacral","Solar Plexus"],"Planets":["Earth"],"Elements":["Earth","Fire"],"Zodiacs":["Gemini"],"id":"sphalerite","relURL":"/crystals/sphalerite","name":"Sphalerite","Formula":"ZnS","Hardness":{"min":3.5,"max":4},"Related":[{"Uvite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/uvite"},{"Magnetite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/magnetite"},{"Orpiment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/orpiment"},{"Pyrophyllite ":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pyrophyllite"},{"Schalenblende":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/schalenblende"},{"Tiger Iron":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/tiger-iron"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Sphalerite":"Sphalerite, also known as zinc blende and black-jack, is a zinc sulfide mineral that crystallizes in the form of masses, botryoidal, cubes, tetrahedral crystals, and dodecahedral crystals. Its most commonly silver and grey, but can also be seen as red, black, yellow, brown, green, and colorless. Sphalerite was discovered in 1847 by E.F. Glocker and was named after the Greek word meaning “treacherous”. Like most minerals during this time period, crystals that looked similar were just called under the same name. Sphalerite got its name from it constantly being confused with Galena. Its very common to find Sphalerite formed with a variety of minerals such as Fluorite, Pyrite, Galena, Dolomite, Quartz, and Calcite. Sphalerite is a common mineral that can be found all over the world, with the best specimens coming out of Mexico, Morocco, Switzerland and Franklin, New Jersey.","Meaning & Energy":"Sphalerite is here to help ground your energies and activate your lower 3 chakras. It raises one's courage, drive, and focus levels to heights they never knew they had within. This mineral helps one truly believe in themselves, and their ability to unlock their full potential in this life. Sphalerite pushes one to realize that their dreams are within their grasps and the only way to get there is through hard work and dedication.

It can be seen in a variety of different colors such as red, blue, green, violet, black, yellow, orange, grey, brown, white, and even colorless. Up until 1783 red Spinel was always classified as Ruby, however shortly after it was understood to be chemically different. This mineral was first discovered in 1779, but had been known for centuries prior. J. Demeste was credited for its initial recording as well as the naming of it. He chose to derive the name from the Latin word “spinella” which means “little thorn”. Some of the best Spinel in the world comes out of Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Myanmar, and Thailand. Other notable deposits are located in Afghanistan, Nepal, Madagascar, Nigeria, and Tanzania.","Meaning & Energy":"Spinel helps with the overall flow of one’s energy and assists in the realignment of their entire chakra body. Your mental awareness will immediately become raised and strengthen the connection you have to your physical and emotional body. One will be able to better pinpoint what part of their body may be “off” and identify underlying emotions that are being suppressed. Spinel shines a light on these fractured pieces of who we truly are, providing endless amounts of light and love to rejuvenate us. This mineral connects with Mother Earth to help provide uplifting vibrations from your home planet. Spinel channels the healing powers of nature and Earth to regenerate your life force energy to keep you going. With this extremely pure and potent energy, one will soon be able to feel like a better version of themselves. A more complete you that has the energy, confidence, and desire to make any needed change to your life. You will soon notice yourself looking at life through a different “lens” and become more in touch with the environment around you. You’ll tend to notice yourself picking up the energies of animals and humans, much like that of an empath.","Compassion Through Spinel":"This outwardly connection is vital to one’s self growth and happiness. The compassion we have towards others is rewarded with pure joy being channeled through our spirit. This energy can change one’s entire attitude and mental state. Spinel shows one that we must grow by evolving with the ones around us. No matter how strong you become, you are still only one singular soul. By having everyone around you on the same frequency, a new kind of love can conjure and become a vital part of your spiritual evolution."},"props":{"Abundance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/abundance","Action":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/action","Adventures":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/adventures","Alignment

Cactus Quartz or Pineapple Quartz, is a type of Quartz encrusted with a second generation of smaller crystals grown atop their face. The way to differentiate this Quartz variety from (also known as Artichoke Quartz) is by looking for the overlapping growth of crystals to face away from their main point. Oftentimes this mineral can be made up of Amethyst, Citrine, and Smoky Quartz with exotic arrays of natural pink, purple, and white being showcased. The only known locality for this crystal is in Mkobola, Nkangala District, Mpumalanga, in South Africa. This lucrative discovery has created the potential for the local villagers to profit off of this completely unique variety of Mother Earth.","Meaning & Energy":"This stone is here to push you into a growth cycle that knows no bounds. We can easily release bad vibrations when we allow ourselves to connect to Spirit Quartz and its protective energies. An etheric shield is naturally placed around your being as a defensive mechanism to help heal you during times of dire growth. There is no need to interrupt your own developmental process as this will take away the time and energy needed for yourself. The everyday monotony of society cannot affect us when we are inside this energy shell.

The minerals usually cross at a 60 or 90 degree angle, with some specimens representing a perfect perpendicular cross. Staurolite’s genetic makeup is very complex, containing aluminum, zinc, magnesium and iron. They can be found within a matrix, most commonly Quartz and Muscovite schist, or as loose crystals due to their durability. You will usually see Staurolite as black or dark brown, but also as a deep to brownish red. This mineral has been referenced throughout history by multiple different people, but it wasn’t until 1792 that it was officially recorded as “Staurolite”. J.C. Delamethrie coined the name from the Greek word “stauros”, meaning “cross”. Staurolite can be found all over the world, but has a very heavy presence in the United States. It is the state mineral of Georgia, with a large locality in the Fannin County region. Another deposit is located about 330 miles to the northeast in Patrick County, Virginia. They have a large park called Fairy Stone State Park, where an abundance of this unique mineral is located. Outside of the United States, Staurolite can also be found in Russia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, France, Italy, and Switzerland.","Spotting Fakes":"This mineral has been known to be artificially created, due to the shape and lore behind it. One way to easily identify if a piece is fake is by getting a good, close up look at it. If there are any small air bubbles that you can see with your eyes or feel with your fingers, then it is more than likely fake. These pieces are usually created in a very hot oven or kiln that leaves traces of oxygen within. Also, if you end up encountering a few of these minerals from the same dealer, be sure to look at them all together at once. Do any of these closely resemble one another? Staurolite is much like humans, with each piece being different from the other. Usually artificial Staurolite is made from one single-shaped mold, resulting in each piece being exactly the same.","Meaning & Energy":"Staurolite activates and aligns one’s third eye, heart and root chakras together. These vital points alone are extremely powerful, but when combined, one’s spiritual path has no limits. This mineral promotes the highest version of oneself by channeling potent energy down to Earth. This otherworldly knowledge can be used directly on one’s life path and spiritual journey. With your third eye being so illuminated, one is able to intersect messages and visuals coming directly from our spirit guides. If you place this stone over your forehead and allow yourself to enter a deep meditation, watch as your mind becomes imbued with new thoughts and ideas. These “visions” have an astronomical amount of weight behind them and symbolically show one the way through stressful times. Much like dreaming, this state of mind can feel distorted and may be lost shortly after your session has concluded. It's important to take action with this information and apply it towards your life.","Listen To Your Heart":"Staurolite is a reminder that we control our own fate in this world, but we need to listen to the one’s helping us along our journey. Don’t be afraid to listen to your heart as well. The unique connection this stone has between the heart and third eye allows one to see the pain we might normally hide. It forces us to face these negative emotions and move on from them. Staurolite helps provide emotional protection and bring to light the inner strength one possesses within. Once one is able to cleanse themselves of these overstayed emotions, they can begin to tackle life again with a clear heart and mind. Continue carrying your Staurolite piece and tap into its energy field when needed. This stone is an ally for life that should be called upon during any bout of sadness, tragedy or pain."},"props":{"Peace of

Stibnite is normally seen as a metallic grey or silver, but can also be found in a lighter black and normally containing a large amount of tarnish. This mineral was first reported in 1832 by F.S. Beaudant and was named from the Latin word “Stibium” meaning “antimony”. The largest known deposits of Stibnite is found in the Hunan Province of China and are responsible for a large percent of pieces on the market today.

One special variety that displays this characteristic is a mineral by the name of Atlantisite (Stichtite formed within a Serpentine host rock). Its color is predominantly lilac purple, but can also be lavender and pink. It was first discovered in 1910 in Tasmania, Australia by A.S. Wesley. He chose to name it after the mine’s manager, Robert Carl Sticht; an American metallurgist and chief executive of the infamous Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company. Since it’s initial extraction over 110 years ago, Stitchite has only been found a handful of times. These deposits are in Australia, Tasmania, South Africa, Canada, Zimbabwe, Sweden, Russia, Brazil, and India.","Meaning & Energy":"Stichtite is a very unique and complex stone. It emits energies that directly activate and connect the heart, third eye, and crown chakra. This interesting bond is highly unusual in nature, with very few stones we’ve ever worked with having this initial capability. Upon receiving the purple rays of light from Stichtite, one's intuitive and emotional body seamlessly reacts to one another. This encourages self growth and healing by having your feelings and heartfelt issues at the forefront of your brain. One will become empathic to themselves and strive to restore love and nurture into their own aura. During this experience, the third eye is extremely open and is capable of seeing past any false sense of reality. This psychic ability enables one to understand the root of their internal pain and where the true cause really comes from. So often we try to hide traumatic emotions from our own mind. We constantly look towards incorrect sources of restoration and even sometimes try to fill the void with external substances. Stitchtite’s energies remind you to listen to your inner spirit and open your heart for the world to see.","Focused Meditation":"When meditating with this stone, focus on releasing your emotions. Try sitting up right with your feet crossed while placing your favorite piece of Stichtite directly on top of your head. Let the vibrations release themselves and go directly to your mind. Watch as your thoughts expand and your decision making ability becomes harmonized. One will soon begin to question if this negative ideology or experience is worth being upset over. A majority of the time you will be able to answer that with honesty and ascend from that toxic reality. If you are not able to, the brain will not go into survival mode once more (as it has had to do on numerous occasions to bear the weight of your unwanted experience), instead it will look for ways to relax and slowly release these delicate emotions. Stichtite will not be the final answer to all of your problems, but it will change your way of thinking and remind you just how important your health truly is."},"props":{"Calming and

& Origin of Stilbite":"Stilbite is a sodium calcium hydrous aluminum silicate that is a member of the family. This mineral crystallizes in the form of thin flattened plates, tabular crystals, as well as aggregates. Its commonly found in association with Apophyllite and Heulandite within basalt and other volcanic rock. Stilbite’s color is usually white but can be seen as brown, pink, yellow, orange, red or grey. This mineral was first discovered in 1797 by J.C. Delametherie, but wasn’t named until 1801 by R.J. Hauy.  The finest Stilbite specimens are found in Western India, near the Poona region. Other notable localities include Iceland, Italy, Scotland, and the USA. The very rare mineral Cavansite is usually found formed on a bed of tiny Stibnite crystals in Poona, India. This combination mineral is extremely rare and and offers up some of the strongest energies from a stone we’ve ever come in contact with. When these 2 minerals meet, they create the ultimate dream stone that fully opens one third eye and crown chakra. These minerals together are extremely expensive and should only be bought from a reliable dealer to avoid purchasing a lower quality specimen that has been heat treated or dyed.","Meaning & Energy":"Stilbite is a very compassionate stone whose soothing vibrations can be felt upon touch. Loving and healing vibrations emanate from Stilbite and fills the entire environment it’s placed in with joy, passionate, and uplifting energies. This stone connects our heart, third eye, and crown chakras together and helps one clearly see the emotions weighing on their heart space. Stilbite is here to help one heal from any pain and trauma they’ve been through, and release these bonds from our heart. Meditating with this stone will help soften these emotions, allowing one to see with clarity how it’s possible to move forward and grow from events that still hurt us to this day. The strengthened connection created between our heart and mind will also help one become much more in touch with their emotional body. One's mind will better understand their emotional side in the moment and learn how to deal with negative energies better."},"props":{"Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Love & Relationships":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/love-relationships","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Mental Enhancement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mental-enhancement","Motivation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/motivation","New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Nourishing and Rejuvenation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nourishing-and-rejuvenation","Nuturing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nuturing","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Psychic Abilities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/psychic-abilities","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Soothing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/soothing","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Channeling":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/channeling","Channeling and Grounding Higher Vibrations":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/channeling-and-grounding-higher-vibrations","Dreams":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/dreams","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Expansion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expansion","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/227/conversions/Stilbite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/227/Stilbite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Stromatolite.wav","Parent Property":[],"Colors":["Grey","White","Yellow","Red","Brown"],"Zodiacs":["Pisces"],"Elements":["Earth"],"Planets":["Earth"],"Chakras":["Root"],"id":"stromatolite","relURL":"/crystals/stromatolite","name":"Stromatolite","Formula":"CaCO3","Hardness":{"min":4,"max":7},"Related":[{"Grenatite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/grenatite"},{"Vesuvianite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/vesuvianite"},{"Chiastolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/chiastolite"},{"Agni Manitite (Pearl of the Divine Fire)":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/agni-manitite-pearl-of-the-divine-fire"},{"Rhyolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/rhyolite"},{"Maligano Jasper":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/maligano-jasper"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Stromatolites":"Stromatolites are fossilized layered deposits of algae within ancient sedimentary rock. These old single-celled organisms are believed to be some of the first forms of life on this planet. Some cyanobacteria (algae) in the rock dates back over 3.5 billion years. Stromatolites range in a variety of colors and can contain many impurities within the bedrock (which is usually limestone). The most common colors we’ve encountered are brown, beige, reddish-brown, yellow, white, and grey. Stromatolites can be found all over the world, with an abundance located in Morocco, Australia, Canada, the United States, as well as the northern European and Baltic states.","First Signs of Life":"Stromatolites help connect one to ancient Earth and the energies Mother Nature emanated a few billion years ago. This time period was filled with a more pure and unfeathered energy that was in an innocent, infantile state. These vibrations filled Earth’s ever-growing environment with life-force energy capable of enhancing plant and microbiological life. This extinct energy is trapped within this crystal and can be channeled into your soul through deep meditative sessions. One must devote an abundant amount of time and effort into their Stromatolite crystal in order to gain access into this knowledge. As each year has passed since the encapsulation of this single celled organism, the life force energy has become incredibly more taxing to access. Some Stromatolites that were created during the very beginning of the creation of this planet have been dormant for upwards of almost 4 billion years.","Meaning & Energy":"The method we suggest to assist one in grounding and infusing their energies with this ancient crystal is to harmonize and activate your root chakra. Try placing your Stromatolite directly in front of you and clear your mind of all thoughts and ideas. Place the image of this stone at the forefront of your mind and envision the world as it was. All of the beauty and destruction that was necessary to create a habitable place for you to call home. Slowly begin to take in as much knowledge from this visionary experience as possible and allow time for your subconscious mind to digest these higher frequencies. Continue working with this stone a few times a week and one will begin to see themselves open up to the world around them. One will gain a newfound view of their daily environment, as well as a higher appreciation and love for the living beings around you. Through this “new” set of eyes, one puts themselves on an endless path towards joy, happiness, love, and enlightenment."},"props":{"Motivation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/motivation","Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Power":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/power","Personal

Historically it’s been referred to as “Brimstone”, due to the smell of rotting eggs when struck together. Its color can range from a light pale yellow, to a bold-defining gold that resembles rays of the sun. Although this mineral can be found throughout the world in places such as Canada, Japan, and the United States, the main commercialized deposits are coming out of Brazil.","Meaning & Energy":"Sulfur Quartz resonates directly with one's personal will and helps reignite the inner emotions that drive us forward each day. A renewed growth cycle will begin to engage your body when tapping into this stone’s energies. This new found perspective of yourself and the world around you will help you see what it is you truly want. A majority of souls that are lost in the world have no vision of what they view as important and achievable. This leads people down a scary path full of sadness, monotony, and emotional carnage. One of the major defining factors of Sulfur Quartz is it’s passive ability to lead one’s mind while providing hope for your emotional body and spirit. Allow your newly illuminated core to infuse with your own unique cognitive abilities. Remind oneself of the power you possess, and begin to display it through creating, manifesting, building, and driving forward each day.","Amplify Your Desires":"Sulfur Quartz enables you to truly create your own path in this world while directing your full attention to achieving your goals and desires. As you begin working with this stone and become more comfortable with it’s vibrations, one must begin to channel their own energies into it. Grab a piece of Sulfur Quartz and begin placing your most desired intentions into it. This can be done through extreme mental focus or vocal repetitions. This is vital as it makes your dreams and desires physical and known to the universe. The Quartz is an enhancing crystal and will strengthen this newly conjured energy, while channeling it directly towards your personal will. This allows one’s body to become enchanted and strengthened, while maintaining a clear mind with laser sharp focus. Lastly, this crystal will provide you with reassurance that the journey you are on is the right one!"},"props":{"Power":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/power","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Life Path":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/life-path","Living in the Present Moment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/living-in-the-present-moment","Longevity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/longevity","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Mastering Fear":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mastering-fear","Passion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/passion","Personal Will":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/personal-will","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Self-Discipline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discipline","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Consciousness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/consciousness","Abundance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/abundance","Action":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/action","Confidence":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/confidence","Courage":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/courage","Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality","Creativity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creativity","Determination":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/determination","Exercising and Sports":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/exercising-and-sports","Expansion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expansion","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/4733/conversions/Sulfur-Quartz-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/4733/Sulfur-Quartz.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Sunstone.wav","Chakras":["Solar Plexus","Sacral"],"Zodiacs":["Leo","Libra"],"Elements":["Fire"],"Colors":["Orange","Gold","Amber"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Planets":["Sun"],"id":"sunstone","relURL":"/crystals/sunstone","name":"Sunstone","Formula":"K(AlSi3O8)","Hardness":{"min":6,"max":7},"Related":[{"Pink Halite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pink-halite"},{"Selenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/selenite"},{"Peridot":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/peridot"},{"Candle Quartz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/CandleQuartz"},{"Hanksite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/hanksite"},{"Rainbow Moonstone":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/rainbow-moonstone"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Sunstone":"Sunstone is an oligoclase feldspar that can only be found crystallized in large masses (rarely can one find Sunstone in tabular or prismatic form). The name comes from its obvious resemblance to the sun, especially when exhibiting radiant reflections that show “flash” or chatoyancy (commonly caused by inclusions of Goethite or Hematite). A lot of Sunstone throughout the world has slight differences in color and can range from peach-pink to bright orange, as well as a light red. Rarely (and I mean rarely) is one able to find completely natural Sunstone that ranges in color from a dark blue to a slight see-through ivory green. This mineral has a history of at least a few hundred years and was discovered in 1837 by J.D. Dana. Since then, important localities have been discovered in Sri Lanka, India, Mexico, Norway, Russia, China, Canada and the United States (Oregon specifically).","Meaning & Energy":"Sunstone resonates directly with one’s solar plexus and sacral chakras. It helps align the two, while creating an important communication channel. This specific area of the body houses crucial personal energies such as one's passion, creativity, personal will, and determination. Sunstone’s energies help revitalize these basic components which make up who we are. In addition, it will help channel those energies through your emotional and mental bodies. As the “sunny” rays of this crystal begin to imbue your entire body and aura, one may soon begin to go through a slight transformation process. This can lead to a change in their current lifestyle, including relationships, hobbies, interests, and ideas. The recently ignited fire within you will play a role in each and every decision you make. As soon as a certain event or person enters your life and draws a significant amount of your attention, one will know what this transformation process was constructing for you. This will be a path to total happiness and success. A path only dreamable by people who deem it achievable. The powers of Sunstone will prove what is capable when the body and mind work together in unison."},"props":{"Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Luck and Good Fortune":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/luck-and-good-fortune","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Clearing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/clearing","Cleansing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/cleansing","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Consciousness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/consciousness","Leadership":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/leadership","Abundance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/abundance","Aura Cleansing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/aura-cleansing","Chakra Cleansing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/chakra-cleansing"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/141/conversions/IMG_0520-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/141/IMG_0520.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Super%20Seven.wav","Parent Property":[],"Chakras":["Etheric","Root","Solar Plexus","Sacral","Heart","Throat","Third Eye","Crown"],"Colors":["Violet","Gold","Yellow","Purple","Red","Colorless"],"Planets":["Mars","Pluto","Neptune","Uranus","Saturn","Jupiter","Earth","Venus","Mercury"],"Zodiacs":["Virgo","Cancer","Leo","Gemini","Taurus","Pisces","Libra","Aquarius","Capricorn","Sagittarius","Scorpio"],"Elements":["Earth","Storm"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"super-seven","relURL":"/crystals/super-seven","name":"Super Seven","Formula":"n{SiO2} p{Fe3+24AlO6(PO4)17(OH)12}•75H2O q{α-Fe3+O(OH)}","Hardness":{"min":7,"max":7},"Related":[{"Angel Aura Quartz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/angel-aura-quartz"},{"Danburite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/danburite"},{"Goshenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/goshenite"},{"Campo del Cielo (Meteorite) ":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/campo-del-cielo-meteorite"},{"Tektite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/tektite"},{"Purpurite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/purpurite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Super Seven":"Super Seven, also known as Melody Stone or Sacred Stone, is an extremely rare mineral with seven crystals in one. The crystals are Amethyst, Cacoxenite, Goethite, Lepidocrocite, Rutile, Smoky Quartz, and Quartz (which all the minerals are usually naturally encased in). This unique mineral only has one small locality in the entire world, and that mine is currently flooded and underwater. The mine was located in Brazil, in the tiny southeastern coastal state known as Espírito Santo. Since the flooding took place, there has been said to be other discoveries of Super Seven. One was in the northern state of Bahia in Brazil, while the other was a small mine in India. Neither one of these locations have found authentic Super Seven, and are actually the main reason why the market has “Super Five” and “Super Six” crystals today. The mines in both these countries believed that they had found a new mineral and coined a derivative name, like that of their so called “parent stone”. As you can probably guess by the name, these crystals were missing a few of the most important minerals that make Super Seven the powerhouse stone it is today. It’s important to note that sometimes not all of the minerals occur in a singular cut or tumbled stone. Many dealers will still try and get away with selling the stone for top value, simply because it's so hard to identify each crystal within. When purchasing this stone make sure it is from a reliable dealer. Trustworthy salesmen may even go the extra length in helping you identify the crystals within each individual piece.","Meaning & Energy":"Super Seven is the key ingredient to accessing the spirit realm and unlocking the knowledge and ancient beings within. The high frequency of this stone helps one attune their energy to that of celestial beings, allowing one to better understand the meaning and purpose of their soul. Super Seven helps provide answers to questions one may have for an entire lifetime, while also ushering in the ability to connect to one's past life experiences. These past life episodes contain ancient knowledge one has been able to carry with them for multiple lifetimes. This unique blend of minerals helps bring this knowledge to the forefront, so that it may be unlocked and used in one’s current life."},"props":{"Gentle

Platt and its color ranges from colorless to yellow, to brown, grey, and most commonly its infamous blue-purple. A common legend states that the blue color within Tanzanite was actually the result of a powerful lighting storm around 30 years prior to the stone’s discovery. This legend details the storm’s strikes created a wide spread fire that heated the surface enough to change the color of the Zoisite variety. The largest natural piece of Tanzanite ever recorded weighs in at 123 carats, but any gem greater than 5 carats is extremely rare to find. Since Tanzanite’s inception on the market, most notably by the New York based jewelers, Tiffany and Co., the market has been flooded with fakes.

They’re normally found in various shades of black, but can also be seen as dark brown and grey (green shades of tektites found in Czech Republic are called Moldavite). Tektites can be found all over the world, with localities in the United States, China, Vietnam, Thailand, Australia, and throughout northwest Africa.","Meaning & Energy":"Tektites resonate at a very high frequency, enabling one to elevate their consciousness to new dimensional heights. One’s internal energy will immediately begin to raise upon touch, with your mind becoming a receptor of incoming knowledge from above. This information is being siphoned through our realm by dream work, deja vu experiences, daily synchronicities, and heightened cognitive & psychic abilities. The source of this knowledge is the angels above, our spirit guides, and our elestial protectors. These beings have been with us since birth, with others intersecting our life path along the way. Their purpose is to help grow and direct your soul in the right direction, allowing you to explore the most heightened version of yourself. Through deep meditation, one is able to understand these signs and when to go about implementing the sudden change.","Expansion of the Mind":"The extraterrestrial component of this stone is one that should be highly utilized by all practitioners. Simply placing this stone on any of your chakras will not only spotlight their traits, but also enhance it. For example, if one was yearning for clarity and expansion of the mind, they should place their Tektite piece on top of their head. If you were looking to open up your third eye and increase your etheric vision, a Tektite placed upon the forehead will do wonders. Through enough experiences, one will easily be able to tap into the powers this E.T. stone offers, and channel it immediately within themselves."},"props":{"Alignment with the Higher

Look-Alike":"There are a lot of so-called “Thulite” specimens coming out of North Carolina. Although this mineral may look similar, it is actually a crystal called Clinothulite. This mineral is a sister mineral of Clinozoisite that also has Manganese inclusions. Clinothulite has very few localities in the world other than North Carolina, so just be careful purchasing Thulite if it's from there.","Meaning & Energy":"Thulite is a stone that radiates love, compassion, happiness, joy and serenity. Potent vibrations of this stone can be felt when standing near a larger piece or when holding it in your hand. Subtle, yet soft energy begins to imbue your aura, resonating directly with your heart. These pink rays are here to aid you as you embark on a journey into the depths of your soul. Thulite pushes old emotional pain to the forefront, urging you to face these negative experiences once and for all. This weight may have been carried for far too long and has been consciously driven down in a refusal of acceptance. Thulite will end that way of thinking and provide you with endless amounts of healing vibrations. By facing and removing these “inner demons” from your heart, one will become stronger and allow a more pure form to shine through. We urge you to carry a piece with you as you begin your self-healing journey. Become comfortable with Thulite’s energy and begin deep meditation sessions with a piece placed directly over your heart.","Healing Emotional Wounds":"We can’t recommend this stone enough to anyone dealing with any sort of emotional pain, especially that of a broken heart. It immediately provides comfort and acts as a support stone for you to “lean” on. Envision this stone giving you an ethereal hug in which its energy will shield you from anymore unnecessary pain and trauma. Lastly, for all those who suffer from constant PTSD, try meditating with a piece of Thulite directly over your third eye. A relatively unknown trait is that Thulite is able to open up one’s mind and expand their mental consciousness. This is ideal for anyone constantly being triggered by their surrounding environment. It's a stone for one to escape too, while providing the necessary energy to keep pushing you forward."},"props":{"Physical Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/physical-healing","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Love & Relationships":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/love-relationships","Mastering Fear":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mastering-fear","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Nourishing and Rejuvenation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nourishing-and-rejuvenation","Nuturing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nuturing","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Passion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/passion","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","PTSD":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ptsd","Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Soothing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/soothing","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Trauma":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trauma","Self-Love":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-love","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Claiming Wholeness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/claiming-wholeness","Compassion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/compassion","Empathy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/empathy","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Enhancing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enhancing","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Generosity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/generosity","Grief and Mourning":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grief-and-mourning","Grounding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grounding","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/343/conversions/thulite-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/344/conversions/thulite-mass-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/343/thulite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Tiger%20Eye.wav","Chakras":["Solar Plexus","Sacral","Root"],"Zodiacs":["Leo","Capricorn"],"Elements":["Fire","Earth"],"Colors":["Yellow","Gold","Brown"],"Planets":["Sun"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"tiger-eye","relURL":"/crystals/tiger-eye","name":"Tiger Eye","Formula":"SiO2","Hardness":{"min":4,"max":7},"Related":[{"Amber":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/Amber"},{"Mahogany Obsidian":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/mahogany-obsidian"},{"Pyrite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pyrite"},{"Pyrophyllite ":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/pyrophyllite"},{"Orpiment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/orpiment"},{"Obsidian (Black)":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/obsidian"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Tiger Eye":"Tiger Eye is a variety of Quartz and a pseudomorph (meaning false form) replacement of Crocidolite. It forms when Crocidolite has its chemical fibers replaced by silica. Its colors are generally a combination of golden browns, yellow, beige or tan. This mineral was first reported in 1892 by J.D. Dana and was clearly named after its similarities to a real tiger’s eye. The most abundant source of Tiger Eye is located beneath South Africa where most of the material on the market is sourced from. However, there are secondary deposits coming from India, Burma, Australia, China, and Brazil.","Chatoyant Cat’s Eye":"Tiger Eye is known for its chatoyancy and shine when placed under the right light. When a piece is cut and polished correctly, you may be able to see a true “cat’s eye” formation. A cat’s eye is a light shimmering glaze that coats the stone but is incredibly hard to see unless it’s under the right light. This effect is caused by the mineral’s natural parallel structures and reflective light that hits these minute, needle-like fibers. Tiger Eye and all of its varieties (Hawk-Eye, Pietersite, Red Tiger Eye) are some of the very few minerals in existence capable of exhibiting this magical chatoyant effect.","Energy & Meaning":"Tiger Eye is one of our favorite crystals for activating both our personal will and solar plexus chakra. When we open and engage our second brain, known as our gut, we are able to display a true array of emotions and qualities. If we allow ourselves to focus, our possibilities will become limitless and know no bounds. Opportunities and new beginnings will attach to you like a magnet when working this stone. It is up to you as to whether or not you would like to take advantage of what the universe is offering. This ever-loving energy is always actively expanding our consciousness and seeking to push us onto a higher path. Tiger Eye is a small tool that grants us the intuition to follow by feel and not by thought.","Manifestation":"We recommend meditating with Tiger Eye each morning or night with your ideas and desires at the forefront of your mind. Say these thoughts out loud so the universe can take hold of these dreams and make them become a reality. When channeling Tiger Eye’s powers, we become imbued with conjuring energy. These vibrations know no bounds and place us in an environment where our ideas can become a reality. Try pairing this mineral with other creative stones like Orange Calcite, Bumblebee Jasper, Pyrite, Mahogany Obsidian, Orange Aventurine, and Citrine!"},"props":{"Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Balance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balance","Creativity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creativity","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Protection":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/protection","Prosperity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/prosperity","Balancing Polarities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/balancing-polarities","Longevity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/longevity","Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality","Luck and Good Fortune":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/luck-and-good-fortune"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/422/conversions/Tiger-Eye-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/423/conversions/IMG_1901-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/422/Tiger-Eye.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Tiger%20Iron.wav","Colors":["Pale Yellow","Pale Brass","Silver","Brass-Yellow"],"Parent Property":[],"Chakras":["Sacral","Solar Plexus","Root"],"Elements":["Fire","Earth"],"Planets":["Earth"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Zodiacs":["Leo"],"id":"tiger-iron","relURL":"/crystals/tiger-iron","name":"Tiger Iron","Formula":"n{Fe2O3} p{SiO2}","Hardness":{"min":5,"max":7},"Related":[{"Lemon Calcite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/lemon-calcite"},{"Imperial Topaz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/imperial-topaz"},{"Dalmatian Stone":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/dalmatian-stone"},{"Heliodor":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/heliodor"},{"Brazilianite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/brazilianite"},{"Sulfur Quartz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/sulfur-quartz"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Tiger Iron":"Tiger Iron is a special combination of stones that can only be found in Western Australia. The stone consists of banded layers of Hematite, Red Jasper, and Tiger Eye. Tiger Iron is one of the oldest stones we’ve ever worked with, being formed more than 2.2 billion years ago. This unique stone was formed by Iron bearing Quartz (Tiger Eye & Jasper) replacing the mineral Crocidolite. The name derives from the inclusion of Iron and Tiger Eye, with Tiger Eye and Red Jasper being members of the Quartz family. Most Tiger Iron on the market is sold as palm stones, tumbled pocket stones, small obelisk carvings, as well as beautiful jewelry. Although this mineral is rare, it's very common for jewelers to cut and cab this stone due to it having a similar hardness to Quartz.","Meaning & Energy":"Tiger Iron is a very powerful stone, combining 3 mineral’s energies into one. Our root, sacral, and solar plexus chakras become activated and aligned when working with or carrying this stone. When these chakras are open and working together, we are reminded that anything in this world is achievable through focus, hard work, and dedication. The Hematite within helps keep one’s thoughts and ideas grounded while keeping your mental state clear. By having a clear mind you will become much more open to ideas and how you can use them to affect your life. Hematite is like a magnet and attracts similar energy to that in which you radiate. Red Jasper’s energies help increase your strength, focus, determination, and endurance. It fully roots us down to Earth, pushing us into physical action to get things done. This stone reduces that inner procrastination that leads to ideas, projects, and goals never coming to fruition. Seeing this over a long period of time will gradually reduce ones confidence in themselves and their overall abilities. That’s where Tiger Eye comes in! Tiger Eye is such a powerful stone and will imbue your aura with endless rays of self-confidence and strength. Tiger Eye quite literally gives you the “eye of the tiger”, making any dream or idea possible. This special Quartz mineral will activate one's personal will and help them stay focused on the task at hand. One may feel a strengthened connection between themselves and they’re work, which can sometimes be the feeling they’ve been missing for so long. These 3 minerals and their abilities make Tiger Iron the highly sought after stone it is today! "},"props":{"Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Living in the Present Moment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/living-in-the-present-moment","Longevity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/longevity","Manifestation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/manifestation","Mastering Fear":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mastering-fear","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Motivation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/motivation","New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Personal Will":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/personal-will","Power":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/power","Prosperity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/prosperity","Life Path":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/life-path","Self-Discipline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discipline","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Selflessness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/selflessness","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Sexuality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sexuality","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Strength":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/strength","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality","Abundance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/abundance","Action":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/action","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Confidence":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/confidence","Courage":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/courage","Creativity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creativity","Determination":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/determination","Exercising and Sports":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/exercising-and-sports","Focus":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/focus","Grounding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grounding","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Leadership":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/leadership"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/196/conversions/IMG_2148-2-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/196/IMG_2148-2.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Titanium%20Quartz.wav","Chakras":["Crown","Third Eye","Throat","Heart","Solar Plexus","Sacral","Root"],"Zodiacs":["Aries","Taurus","Gemini","Cancer","Leo","Virgo","Libra","Scorpio","Sagittarius","Capricorn","Aquarius","Pisces"],"Elements":["Fire","Storm"],"Colors":["Silver"],"Planets":["Sun","Moon"],"id":"titanium-quartz","relURL":"/crystals/titanium-quartz","name":"Titanium Quartz","Formula":"TiO2@SiO2","Hardness":{"min":7,"max":8},"Related":[{"Elestial Quartz":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/elestial-quartz"},{"Scolecite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/scolecite"},{"Rutile":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/rutile"},{"Auralite-23":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/auralite-23"},{"Moldavite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/moldavite"},{"Noble Shungite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/noble-shungite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Titanium Quartz":"Titanium Quartz is the name of a specially coated type of Quartz.

The Tourmaline included within the Quartz helps activate and open your root chakra, enabling the body and mind to connect to Mother Earth. One can rejuvenate their physical body while also relinquishing negative thoughts or ideas within the mind.

While they are absolutely stunning and contain extremely powerful grounding energies, the market has recently become saturated. This is due to its abundance and the ease of access to the mines for the workers. ","Meaning & Energy":"Tree Agate shares nearly identical energies with Moss Agate, it’s sister crystal!

It is commonly found as an inclusion in Quartz, alongside similar minerals such as Scorzalite and Lazulite. The mineral was originally found in Sweden in 1868, and was named after the famed chemist and attorney general, Hans Gabriel Trolle-Wachtmeister. Originally, it was thought that Trolleite was only found in it’s type locality (initial place of discovery), but throughout the 20th century, more and more deposits began to be unearthed. One of the largest and most important veins of Trolleite in the mineral community comes from the Minas Gerais region in Brazil. From this locality, large deep blue inclusions of Trolleite can be found in huge Quartz masses. This had led Trolleite to become more common amongst the mineral community, simply due to its ability to be cut, shaped, polished, and worn as jewelry.","Meaning & Energy":"Trolleite and it’s sister minerals (Scorzalite and Lazulite) are all stones that engage your upper chakra system, promoting a divine connection between you and your higher self. As one’s consciousness and awareness begins to expand and ascend, significant symbolic events will begin to stand out to your newly awakened third eye. Such events can be extremely minute and last seconds, but have a stinging effect on the brain and body. Something small and normally unacknowledged by the brain can hold such strong meanings, ultimately changing your entire way of thinking. This “new” head on your shoulders will work towards maintaining clarity of the mind, allowing your soul to forge a connection to the universe. Through dimensional travel, one will have the opportunity to understand the secrets of life and the purposeful reason for your place on Earth.","Astral Projection":"This astral projection of your potent consciousness is only achievable through the complete relaxation of the body, mind, and spirit. This holy trinity becomes much more achievable when able to meditate and channel high amounts of external energy. Trolleite is one of the most unique stones we know of for just that purpose. Try meditating with this stone directly over your third eye chakra, with other amplification crystals of the pineal gland (Phenacite, Herkimer Diamond, Fluorite, Moldavite, Quartz). Overtime and through constant repetition, one will have discovered a secret formula to help decalcify the most important parts of our unused brain."},"props":{"Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Longevity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/longevity","Living

member of the feldspathoid family (minerals that resemble feldspars, but have much lower silica content). It usually is found on large masses of Albite with inclusions, as well as near hydrothermal Sodalite veins. Occasionally, the minerals can even occur together, creating an extremely valuable specimen. The color can range from light red to a dark crimson that can brighten and alter its own appearance when exposed to light. This natural occurring phenomenon is called reverse photochromism, also known as being tenebrescent.","Meaning & Energy":"Tugtupite activates and engages our upper four chakras (heart, throat, third eye & crown) while elevating our consciousness in hopes of better understanding our emotional needs. This unique mineral acts as a mirror, helping you to self evaluate each aspect of your spiritual and emotional bodies. Overtime, we constantly change as we experience natural growth cycles here on Earth. Some may find it difficult to conform to society’s pressure and it’s ever changing standards; resulting in emotional pain, confusion, and distress.","Crimson Healing":"Tugtupite ushers in wave after wave of vibrant, crimson self-healing rays. As one begins to absorb these energies, you may notice a difference in your mood and patience level. This is due to you subconsciously working on finding inner peace, especially that of the mind. As our brain churns at a high speed each and every day, we lose touch of the most important thing in this world; ourselves. This drives our mental health to slowly deteriorate as we simply begin to only care about the wrong things. Tugtupite pushes you away from this life-long imprisonment by producing a glimpse of clarity within your mind, especially during deep meditation."},"props":{"Self-Discipline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discipline","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Living in the Present Moment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/living-in-the-present-moment","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","Mental Enhancement":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/mental-enhancement","Motivation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/motivation","New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Nourishing and Rejuvenation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nourishing-and-rejuvenation","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","Passion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/passion","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Physical Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/physical-healing","Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Selflessness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/selflessness","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Spiritual Awakening":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/spiritual-awakening","Soothing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/soothing","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Transformation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/transformation","Trauma":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trauma","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Claiming Wholeness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/claiming-wholeness","Abundance":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/abundance","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Compassion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/compassion","Creating Your Own Reality":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/creating-your-own-reality","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Grief and Mourning":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grief-and-mourning","Grounding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grounding","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Inner Vision":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-vision","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/4005/conversions/Tugtupite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/4005/Tugtupite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Turquoise.wav","Planets":["Venus","Neptune"],"Chakras":["Throat"],"Zodiacs":["Scorpio","Sagittarius","Pisces"],"Elements":["Storm"],"Colors":["Blue","Pale Yellow","Light Blue"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"Parent Property":[],"id":"turquoise","relURL":"/crystals/turquoise","name":"Turquoise","Formula":"CuAl6(PO4)4(OH)8•4H2O","Hardness":{"min":5,"max":6},"Related":[{"Blue Calcite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/blue-calcite"},{"Copper ":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/copper"},{"Chalcopyrite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/chalcopyrite"},{"Saussurite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/saussurite"},{"Creedite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/creedite"},{"Morganite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/morganite"}],"Origin":{"Sciene & Origin of Turquoise":"Turquoise is a copper aluminum mineral.

About 1000 years ago Native Americans began to find out about Turquoise and used it for jewelry, weapons, and amulets.

He named this newly found mineral after the location of his discovery, Uva, Sri Lanka. There is some debate in the geology world as to if this really was the first discovery of Uvite due to its close similarities to (Brown Tourmaline).

Rarely does it occur in crystal form, but when it does it is seen in an octahedral shape. The colors can range from light green to teal, which is similar to that of Turquoise. The green color comes from impurities of Chromium. Variscite can sometimes be seen with a white mineral called Crandallite formed within or on it. These combo specimens are highly desired by jewelers to be cut into cabochons. Variscite was first discovered back in 1837 by A. Breithaupt and was named after the location it was found in, the ancient German Voigtland district, Variscia. Notable modern day localities include the United States (specifically Arizona and Nevada), as well as Australia, Brazil, Spain, Germany, and Poland.","Meaning & Energy":"Variscite is an exceptional heart stone that helps one connect with their inner being. This mineral heavily promotes inner peace and clarity of the mind, while helping one slowly establish control over their emotional body. Working with this mineral helps teach our minds to simplify every situation and stop obsessing over the outcome. We have little control over anything in this world except for our own emotions and how we react. Variscite is here to serve as a reminder of that and push you to slow down and live in the moment. Connect with the things and beings around you and allow their love to transcend you into unimaginable heights. Meditate with this stone daily over your heart space to maximize its healing potential. Focus on the negative emotions that may already exist inside of you when beginning to work with Variscite.","Healing Your Heart":"We suggest using this stone in association with other heart healing stones for the best results. Try meditating with Rose Quartz, Pink Tourmaline, Rhodochrosite, Green Calcite or Chrysoprase. These minerals are all producers of pure love and when combined with Variscite, can fill one’s aura with compassion that touches everything around you. One will soon notice a change in their daily attitude and their perception of the world. Positivity will soon be restored to one's heart and mind, while also maintaining a clear and confident outlook."},"props":{"Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Light":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/light","Living

& Origin of Vesuvianite":"Vesuvianite, also known as Idocrase, is an aluminum calcium magnesium silicate mineral that crystallizes in the form of masses, columnar pillars, and small pyramidal and prismatic crystals. It is found mostly in shades of olive green, but can also occur as brown, yellow, white, purple, pink, and red. Vesuvianite was first discovered in 1795 by German geologist Abraham Gottlob Werner. He chose to name it after the location of the specimen he examined, which was on the lower tiers of Mount Vesuvius in Naples, Italy. During this time, other scientists and researchers were also examining this newly acquired crystal. This led to multiple names being labeled for the same stone throughout Europe, which began to confuse geologists. One such example is of the official recording of “Vesuvianite” as “Idocrase” by French mineralogist Rene Just Huey in 1796, only a year after its first discovery.","Meaning & Energy":"Vesuvianite is an ancient Earthen amulet bearing healing properties that resonate directly with one’s soul center. Our inner core contains our deepest experiences that may transcend time and space. These external occurrences could have occurred in past lives, but were so traumatic, that it affected your soul enough to carry over into your present life. Some examples stem from extreme childhood fears and constant misdirected emotional distress. If not properly dealt with and exhumed from our newly acquired physical vessel, our pain will consume the current life we live. It may not be felt each day, but subconsciously this negativity is gaining more control over your soul daily. To address this, one must bear a fearless mentality and “jump into the fire” of our own emotional plagues. Vesuvianite expels the depths of these experiences and thrusts them to the surface. Through deep meditation, one may begin going through these trauma inducing thoughts and push to relinquish them from not only your life, but your precious soul as well. With each meditation session, Vesuvianite provides one the strength and desire to induce the heart with soothing tranquility, allowing an open well to flow and provide nourishment to our entire body.","Crystal Pairings":"Vesuvianite truly emboldens our heart and solar plexus chakra, forging them together and creating an impenetrable bond. This is vital in understanding ourselves and who we truly are. This is because our gut is our “2nd brain” which houses our purest intuitive energy. Some stones we recommend to help open and unlock these neighboring chakras are Green Kyanite, Green Tiger Eye, Atlantisite, Prehnite , and Infinite."},"props":{"Mastering

This is one of the very few stones where you can see the formation process etched into the mineral. As the Pink Tourmaline in the center was forming and thickening, exposure to additional minerals such as manganese and lithium caused the stone to change color overtime. This special Tourmaline was discovered at a mine in Newry, Maine in 1902, but can be found in Nigeria, Madagascar, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Australia, and Brazil. Brazil is famous for being known as having the finest Watermelon Tourmalines ever discovered, more specifically around the Minas Gerais region of the country. In the early 1970’s a large pocket of extremely high grade Watermelon Tourmaline was found very close to the mine in which it was discovered. Only 5 miles away from Newry, Plumbago Gem Pit started pulling out some of the most amazing specimens ever seen in the world at that time.","Meaning & Energy":"Watermelon Tourmaline is a very powerful heart stone that is here to help calm and soothe your emotions. It helps one access and unlock the deepest parts of one's heart, pushing one to fully cleanse and heal all emotional wounds. Watermelon Tourmaline is the perfect stone to help one combat anxiety and depression that may push one into a dark or sad place. This stone offers up light, love, and rejuvenation to help keep ones heart and mind imbued with joy, general happiness, being more adventurous, having increased daily energy, self-love and confidence are all brought out when wearing or carrying Watermelon Tourmaline. Lovers of this stone generally like to place a piece on a necklace or locket directly over the heart to help combat emotional distress daily."},"props":{"Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Love & Relationships":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/love-relationships","Meditation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/meditation","New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Nourishing and Rejuvenation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nourishing-and-rejuvenation","Nuturing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nuturing","Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","PTSD":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ptsd","Passion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/passion","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Purification":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/purification","Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Self-Discipline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discipline","Selflessness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/selflessness","Sense of Purpose":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/sense-of-purpose","Soothing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/soothing","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Trauma":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trauma","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Compassion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/compassion","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Claiming Wholeness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/claiming-wholeness","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Empathy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/empathy","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Generosity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/generosity","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Grief and Mourning":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/grief-and-mourning","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/175/conversions/watermelon-tourmaline-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/176/conversions/watermelon-tourmaline-1-%281000px%29-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/177/conversions/watermelon-tourmaline-2-%281000px%29-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/178/conversions/watermelon-tourmaline-3-%281000px%29-thumb.jpg","https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/179/conversions/watermelon-tourmaline-4-%281000px%29-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/175/watermelon-tourmaline.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/storage/pronunciations/Wavellite.wav","Colors":["Olive Green ","Venusian-Green","Green","Yellow","Colorless"],"Parent Property":[],"Chakras":["Heart"],"Planets":["Venus","Earth"],"Zodiacs":["Aquarius"],"Elements":["Earth"],"Sacred Numbers":[],"id":"wavellite","relURL":"/crystals/wavellite","name":"Wavellite","Formula":"Al3(PO4)2(OH, F)3 •5H2O","Hardness":{"min":3.5,"max":4},"Related":[{"Actinolite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/actinolite"},{"Fuchsite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/fuchsite"},{"Cobaltoan Calcite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/cobaltoan-calcite"},{"Watermelon Tourmaline":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/watermelon-tourmaline"},{"Dragi (Dragon) Jade":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/dragi-dragon-jade"},{"Morganite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/morganite"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of Wavellite":"Wavellite is a rare phosphate mineral that crystallizes in the form of clusters, stalactites, skinny needle-like crystals, or as a spherical structure. The color most associated with this mineral is green to light green, but can also be found as white, yellow, blue, brown, black, and even colorless. Wavellite was first discovered in Devon, England by W. Babington in 1805. Wavellite was named after the English physicist, William Wavell. Along with forming in phosphate rock, Wavellite can also be found in most aluminous metamorphic rock throughout the world. The most famous locality for Wavellite is in the Ouachita mountain range in Mount Ida, Arkansas. Also known as the Quartz capital of the world, these mountains have produced some of the nicest specimens of Wavellite the world has ever seen. Other notable localities include the UK, Bolivia, Germany, Japan, and Australia.","Meaning & Energy":"Wavellite is a stone of love, peace, truth, compassion and intuition. Our emotional bodies immediately become rejuvenated with powerful life force energy when working with this stone. It brings the softer side out of each one of us that we generally do not allow the world to see. Wavellite pushes one to feel compassion for the ones around us, as well as even helping out complete strangers.This stone brings out the “good” in humanity and is here to bring us all together through love. As one becomes more connected to themselves and the people closest to them, we all begin to share a single life line. Our intuition naturally raises when working with Wavellite and can help one better understand what is bothering you or your loved ones. Naturally, people are hesitant to voice their problems and show one their truest emotions. Wavellite helps bring these emotions to the surface so that they may be dealt with. By facing these feelings and accepting that they’re there, only then can one move forward and begin to grow."},"props":{"Relaxation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/relaxation","Inspiration":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inspiration","Joy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/joy","Knowledge":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/knowledge","Love & Relationships":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/love-relationships","New Beginnings":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/new-beginnings","Nourishing and Rejuvenation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nourishing-and-rejuvenation","Nuturing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/nuturing","Passion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/passion","Peace of Mind":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/peace-of-mind","Physical Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/physical-healing","Purification":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/purification","Insight":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/insight","Resolution":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/resolution","Self- Healing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-healing","Self Discovery":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/self-discovery","Selflessness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/selflessness","Soothing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/soothing","Stress Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/stress-relief","Trust":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/trust","Truth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/truth","Wisdom":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/wisdom","Calming and Patience":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/calming-and-patience","Chakra Cleansing":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/chakra-cleansing","Alignment of Chakra":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/alignment-of-chakra","Anxiety Relief":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/anxiety-relief","Intuition":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/intuition","Claiming Wholeness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/claiming-wholeness","Compassion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/compassion","Emotional Understanding":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/emotional-understanding","Empathy":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/empathy","Enlightenment":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/enlightenment","Expanded Awareness":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expanded-awareness","Expansion":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/expansion","Generosity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/generosity","Gentle Self-Expression":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/gentle-self-expression","Growth":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/growth","Inner Peace":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/inner-peace"},"Additional_Images":["https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/225/conversions/wavellite-thumb.jpg"],"Image":"https://the-crystal-council.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/prod/225/wavellite.jpg"},{"Pronunciation":"https://cdn.reamaze.com/audio/snapup.mp3","Parent Property":[],"Planets":["Neptune"],"Chakras":["Crown","Third Eye"],"Zodiacs":["Gemini","Cancer","Aquarius","Pisces"],"Elements":["Water"],"Colors":["Grey"],"id":"white-calcite","relURL":"/crystals/white-calcite","name":"White Calcite","Formula":"Unknown","Hardness":{"min":1,"max":1},"Related":[{"Stichtite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/stichtite"},{"Colombianite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/colombianite"},{"Mangano Calcite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/mangano-calcite"},{"Goshenite":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/goshenite"},{"Rwanda Amethyst":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/rwanda-amethyst"},{"Blue Chalcedony":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/crystals/blue-chalcedony"}],"Origin":{"Science & Origin of White Calcite":"White Calcite is a common calcium carbonate mineral that crystallizes in the form of masses and cubic formations (due to the layering of the crystal structure). It can be found as pearly/chalky white, as well as pale white and even light grey. When seen as transparent and optical, it is known as Iceland Spar. Most, if not all of the White Calcite on the market comes out of Mexico. The price per piece or pound is extremely cheap and is a stone that should be enjoyed by all!","Meaning & Energy":"White Calcite has the potential to unlock your inner vision and enable one to see more clearly, both in this realm and beyond. With these newly restored talents, one is capable of traversing time and space by accessing their true psychic abilities. This can be done both in the dream realm, as well as during deep meditation sessions. While embracing these experiences, try placing a piece of White Calcite on your third eye. You may begin to feel a slight tingling sensation, as well as an overall euphoric feeling encompassing your entire aura. This is completely natural and is partly why White Calcite is so important to work with! Follow your intuition and lead yourself on your true destined path towards your higher being.","Crystal Pairings":"This variety of calcite is perfect to combine with other higher-tiered chakra stones. Some of our favorites to work with and meditate with are Phenacite, Selenite, Quartz, Tanzanite, Covellite , Cavansite, Kammererite, and Euclase. All of these stones produce their own unique energies that can alter, clear, and provide direct intellect into one’s mind. This experience will expand your daily decision making ability while providing one with endless opportunities to harness and grow into who you truly wish to be. During this phase, one may begin shedding parts of themselves that no longer serve this growth pattern. In extreme cases, some individuals are able to conjure the strength within to relinquish everything they rely on and ultimately change their life path. Let us all be assured that this is perfectly natural and is also called a “self induced awakening”, a spiritual shift that pushes us past our own limitations and boundaries without any hesitation."},"props":{"Psychic

squares, small prismatic and tiny tabular crystals. This mineral is usually golden orange or yellow, but can be found as blue, red, grey, white and even colorless. The color hues come from tiny traces of chromium within the crystal. Wulfenite forms in heavily oxidized lead deposits and can be found in association with a number of other minerals such as Pyromorphite, Mimetite, Hemimorphite, and Smithsonite. The first discovery of this mineral came in 1845 by W. Haidinger in Carinthia, Austria. He named it in honor of Austrian mineralogist Franz Xavier von Wulfen who had previously wrote about the crystals in the lead deposits of Carinthia. The Red Cloud Mine in Arizona has pulled out some of the finest quality crystals of Wulfenite the world has ever seen. Other notable localities include the Los Lamentos mines in Mexico, the Mount Peca mines in Slovenia, as well as veins found within Bulwell, England.","Meaning & Energy":"Wulfenite activates and links our solar plexus and sacral chakras together. This connection activates one's personal will, making any dream or desire feel achievable. Our personal will helps us regain confidence in ourselves and pushes one’s drive, vitality, and determination to levels never felt before. Our minds become clear when working with this stone and will help one see the path to their goals with ease.

It can be found in a variety of yellow hues and gets its color from tiny inclusions of Mica or Muscovite. This Aventurine variety is one of the more rare members of the group, and is usually only found crystallized in the form of large masses. Most of the Yellow Aventurine on the market today comes out of Brazil, but there are also important localities within India.","Meaning & Energy":"Yellow Aventurine resonates directly with one’s solar plexus chakra and pushes one to engage in awakening their personal will. This important attribute houses energies used for manifesting, creating, focusing, as well as important leadership qualities. Without actively using these personal skills regularly, they will become weak and eventually go dormant. Yellow Aventurine, especially when placed on your belly during deep meditation, helps one reestablish their inner connection to these energies. Deep meditative sessions overtime will help one naturally raise their confidence level and become more comfortable with who they really are. Yellow Aventurine removes all self expectations and societal outlooks. This will help one truly understand what exactly their soul is contained of. You will now be able to explore it at a much more spiritual level.","Explore!":"Don’t forget to carry a piece of Yellow Aventurine with you as you create and explore your imaginative side. As your personal will strengthens, so does the energies it carries and the connections they have throughout your body. You will inherently become filled with happiness and joy as you embrace doing what you love. These emotions will help one convey their true identity while also displaying it in unique ways for the world to see."},"props":{"Opportunities":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/opportunities","PTSD":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/ptsd","Power":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/power","Prosperity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/prosperity","Physical

also known as Raw Phantom Calcite, is a recently unearthed variety of calcite. It is a calcium carbonate mineral and one of Earth’s most common stones. This extremely unique variation has only been found within the last few years in Mexico (not to be confused with the Zebra Stone from Western Australia). It exhibits banding patterns throughout the stone which reminds one of a Zebra’s stripes. It may even contain traces of Aragonite. If you haven't yet, expect to see this attractive stone at your next gem show or in your local crystal shop very soon! A majority of the Zebra Calcite coming out of the ground now is just being cleaned and sold on the market purely raw, much like other variations of Calcite. One of our favorite stones of 2020!","Meaning & Energy":"Much like the stone itself, Zebra Calcite exhibits endless transformational energies that are still being produced by the crystal today. When one works with this stone extensively, they too can be sure to completely transform each and every aspect of their life, starting with their own emotional state. Zebra Calcite immediately begins to work with the emotional body and will raise suppressed and neglected feelings to the surface. This forces one’s mind to acknowledge and address the negative experiences that we are holding onto. Realize that these emotions are not part of who you are and do not reflect the beauty you hold inside and out. As you meditate and continue encountering these insecure moments, they will make you a stronger and happier human being. Knowing what you're capable of and how far you've come is the highest feat of strength one can carry with them throughout their time on this planet. With these experiences come knowledge, truth, and an understanding that one is capable of anything they set their mind, heart, and soul into."},"props":{"Motivation":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/motivation","Prosperity":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/prosperity","Power":"https://thecrystalcouncil.com/tags/properties/power","Physical

Calcium Aluminum Silicate minerals. It crystallizes in the form of masses although it can form in small prismatic crystals. This mineral was formerly a part of the Epidote family, however in 2006 it was determined that it is actually its own group of minerals. Zoisites can mainly be found in a green and black striped or spotted pattern, yet they have also been found in yellow, grey, pink, brown and colorless. The purple variety that was recently discovered in Tanzania is known as Tanzanite and is a variety of Zoisite! Zoisite is almost always found alongside other minerals most commonly with Ruby or Pargasite.","Saualpite vs. Zoisite":"Zoisite was originally known through history as Saualpite due to its discovery in Saualpite (Carinthia, Austria). It wasn't until 1805 that A.G. Warner officially recorded and reclassified this subset of minerals to be known as a Zoisite. This naming was in honor of Sigmund Zois Freiherr von Edelstein who was responsible for multiple Austrian mineral expeditions.","Meaning & Energy":"Zoisite’s energy produces growth and fertility in all aspects of life. It helps us “rebirth” and have a better understanding of ourselves and our connection to the outside world. For many people who are not spiritual and recently “awakened” their spirituality, this stone will help you along your journey of rediscovery. Our heart system needs to be held up with a strong foundation and a solid inner working. Zoisite helps expand our heart chakra and allows rejuvenation to flow freely through our body.
